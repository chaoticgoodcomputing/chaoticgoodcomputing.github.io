Letting the vault go stale for a year and a half feels less like falling off the wagon, and more like completely losing the wagon altogether.

## The Season of Systems

I remember, growing up, seeing my dad come home from work every day. Like clockwork, he'd always put his keys in the same place. It varied from house to house, but it's the most atomic example of a person with a system that I can think of: `At X, do Y`.

I'm still working out, in my own mind, how this season will differ from [[public/tags/seasons/rhythm/index|rhythm]] — which has a [[public/content/notes/season-of-rhythm-in-review|review pending]], I'll get around to that sometime soon. The distinguishing factor in my mind, at the moment, is to review and restructure the way I operate, both personally and productively.

Since the last post ([[public/content/notes/periodic/daily/2024-04-21|in April of last year]] — never has 16 months felt longer), a whole lot has changed. I think that I, along with a lot of people in my own (or similar) positions, have suffered a bit of whiplash with how quickly the systems that grew over the course of decades shifted under our feet.

## Agentic Models

Generative AI has come quite a long way from simple [[public/content/articles/binglish|chat interfaces]]. At that point, I think that folks (including myself) thought the primary shift would be what we, now, call AI slop. That's still absolutely the case, but I find myself at the center of where AI, specifically [AI agents](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents) seems to have found its most solid footing — [[public/tags/engineering/index|software engineering]] and white-collar work. As these systems become more competent, it's been a rapid rush to find what the human role in their use becomes.

My thoughts on this are... complicated, to say the least. There's a lot at play, but within specifically those spaces I do find that it's a net benefit.[^1] I've had this conversation with enough people at this point (family, friends, coworkers) that it's almost canned at this point:

1. First, the extent to which any person, myself included, utilizes this system is a constant negotiation with a lot of factors: how expensive the (good) models can be, how useful they actually are in a person's line of work (the ceiling is very high in software development, depending on how you use them), how willing somebody is to "feed the machine". These things have gotten really good, really fast (not sure what the current state of counting the `r`s in `strawberries` is), so not only does it need to be negotiated, but it needs to be *re*negotiated as the landscape changes, which has gotten pretty damn exhausting.
2. As the boundary of what work can be handed off to these systems shifts, my (or anybody else's) role in work also shifts.


^[1]: my biggest knock against LLMs? My writing uses an abusive amount of [em-dashes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use), a habit that I picked up in college because it seemed to be an acceptable way to phrase connected thoughts, asides, or parentheticals that would otherwise be critiqued for being run-on sentences. LLMs have, for some *fucking reason*, decided to [steal this habit out from under me](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/magazine/chatgpt-dash-hyphen-writing-communication.html), and now my writing looks *less* human, not more. I'm still not sure what to do about this.
