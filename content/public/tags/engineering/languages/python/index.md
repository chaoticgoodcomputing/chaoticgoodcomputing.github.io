For much of my [[tags/projects/dayjob/index|early career]], I worked primarily in Python for [[tags/engineering/data/index|data science, analysis, and engineering]]. While I don't use it as much anymore, it's a handy tool for quick prototyping and data projects, especially in [[tags/engineering/ai/index|AI, LLM, and machine learning projects]]. It'll come up from time to time, and those projects will show up here.
