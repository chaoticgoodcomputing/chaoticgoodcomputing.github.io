# Testing Content-Specific Widgets

<GlobalInitialization />

<Initialization />

This page tests widgets from the content widget registry (`content/public/widgets/`).

These are vault-specific widgets that might be used for particular tutorials, demonstrations, or page-specific functionality.

## Greeting Widget

The Greeting widget is a simple example that cycles through different greetings.

import { Greeting } from '@content/widgets/greeting'

<Greeting name="Developer" />

Click the button to cycle through different greeting styles!

## Combining Global and Content Widgets

You can use both global and content widgets on the same page:

import { Counter } from '@widgets/counter'

<Counter initial={0} label="Mix Test" />

<Greeting name="World" />

This demonstrates that both widget systems work together seamlessly.
