I can't emphasize enough: I'm really more of a [[public/tags/engineering/index|backend]], [[public/tags/engineering/devops/index|DevOps]], and [[public/tags/engineering/data/index|data]] person. A lot of my frontend experience is in build systems for [[public/tags/engineering/languages/typescript/index|TypeScript]] applications — things like wrangling (P)NPM dependencies and build times, orchestration via [NX](https://nx.dev/docs/getting-started/intro)
