I had done a few projects in C# back in [[tags/projects/college/index|college]], especially through trying my hand at [[tags/projects/games/index|trying my hand at broader game development]]. That has picked up substantially since starting a [[tags/projects/dayjob/index|dayjob]] at a C# and TypeScript shop.

This page is for all available posts related, either directly or indirectly, to my OSS C# development.
