The [[content/notes/kickoff-season-of-systems|Season of Systems]] is the (long overdue) follow-up to [[content/notes/season-of-rhythm-in-review|Season of Rhythm]]. A lot of this season is focused around developing both personal systems — organizing longer-running tasks, refining how I collect everything I need to do on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis — along with professional systems for staying on top of the many [[content/notes/hostage-negotiations|AI systems]] that have grown out over the past year.
