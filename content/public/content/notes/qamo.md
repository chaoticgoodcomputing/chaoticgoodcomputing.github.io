title: Quantitative Analysis of Markets & Organizations

  My time at the University of Utah was longer than I'd planned, cut shorter than expected by COVID-19.
  I was very lucky to have mentorship to push me across the finish line.

In 2022, I graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in [Quantitative Analysis of Markets & Organizations](https://eccles.utah.edu/programs/undergraduate/academics/majors/qamo/) (QAMO, more-or-less [[tags/economics/index|quantitative economics]]).

Words cannot describe how much I appreciate the mentorship I received from my professors - especially Dr. Scott Schaefer, the program director who was incredibly kind in providing a level of flexibility that, frankly, was the only reason I was able to graduate while working full-time.

That said, I *do* wish the name of the degree wasn't such a pain in the ass to type out.
