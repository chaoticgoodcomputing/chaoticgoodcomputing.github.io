I picked the habit back up as part of Rhythm’s follow-up, season of systems. As a software engineer, it’s become clear to me that LLM systems will continue to be an essential part of the trade moving forward. That said, I want to keep this site a space where I can practice writing, and develop other personal and professional development skills.\nSo: here are the hard lines I’m drawing related to the use of AI on this site:\n\nAI/LLMs will never be used to generate content for these notes. That’s the hardest boundary — this is my space for thoughts and information, and the writing will reflect that.\nAI/LLMs will be used to assist in developing the source code for the site. This site relies on a heavily-modified version of Jacky Zhao’s Quartz framework to parse through my Obsidian vault. I’ve organized the code to make it easier to modify aspects that I care about the most, such as tag processing and the logic for the graph rendering. I can’t emphasize enough that building and designing sites really isn’t my forté — I want my time on this site to be far more focused on its content, and spending my time fumbling through long, inline JS scripts distracts from that.\nAI/LLMs may be used to assist in naming, and adding short metadata descriptions, to posts. Despite how poor some of my writing is, I’d like to think that some of the information on this site could be useful to folks. However, even the most useful information is useless if nobody can actually find it. I may use AI to workshop accurate and efficient titles and descriptions — purely the pieces of data that you’d find when, say, searching online. That said, this will not go unmonitored: I will always be the final approval for post titles and descriptions.\n\nAs for AI consumption of the site:\n\nI’m really not sure there’s much I can do about AI scraping the site. I’m sure there’s some things, but as far as the public portions of the site go, I’m not particularly against that information being read.\nHowever — since restarting Season of System’s, I’ve decided to take portions of this site private. The two primary portions are periodic notes, as well as initial drafts of notes. The metadata for these notes (titles, tags, ingoing and outgoing links) are preserved, but the actual contents of the notes will be replaced in the public version of the site, as well as on GitHub, using a separate git submodule. These all get labelled with the private tag. I’m not against anybody seeing them. If one does look helpful, absolutely reach out. However, I don’t necessarily want them publicly available.\n","date":"2026-01-04T00:00:00.000Z"},"contact":{"slug":"contact","filePath":"contact.md","title":"About Me","links":[],"tags":["horticulture"],"content":"","date":"2026-01-16T07:12:00.000Z"},"content/annotations/clinard-dissertation":{"slug":"content/annotations/clinard-dissertation","filePath":"content/annotations/clinard-dissertation.md","title":"Annotation: Acoustic Modeling of Skull Bone for Improved Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Therapy","links":["contact","content/notes/hostage-negotiations"],"tags":["engineering/bio","writing/annotations","private"],"content":"This note is part of my private vault, and isn’t published publicly on the site or within the public GitHub.\nIf you are interested in what this note contains, please reach out to me!

(derogatory)\nShorthand for a median style of writing, devoid of personality. (derogatory)\n\n\nIn writing a bit more, I’ve been back-and-forth on the extent to which I want to swear. The style of my writing is more-or-less the way that I speak out loud (which prompted a lot of “couldn’t you make this a bit more professional?” feedback on the Databricks post), and when I speak out loud, I swear. Obviously, the frequency depends - at work it’s sparse (but not nil), on a personal level it’s pretty frequent - but I do still pepper it in for effect in some places. The only times I can remember not swearing is when I was teaching math to K-12 students, and when writing posts here.\nThis feels somewhat… internally dissonant? personally disingenuous? If, when I speak I swear, and I tend to write like I speak, why wouldn’t I also swear in my writing? The answer in the past has been professionalism. It feels unbecoming of a (relatively) young professional to swear in a professional context, and some of what I write here overlaps with what I do for work.\nToning down my writing has been, so far, a fairly active effort. I’ve occasionally even gone as far as writing with swears and then, after-the-fact, explicitly (ha!) searching for illicit words and removing them as I see them. This was probably most apparent when writing the Robloxaville recap article - it mentions a lot of my (very) early work history and, at the time, I thought that potential employers (or youths) might come across it, warranting a touch-up.\nThe world has changed quite a bit since ye olde 2021. I am (slightly) more established in my career, and the context of written documentation has changed quite a bit as technology has advanced. This has made me reconsider my previous policy of toning down my writing. In the process of porting over &amp; more frequently updating this blog, I’ve made an executive decision for the foreseeable future: I’m going to be swearing a bit more.\nOr, at the very least, I’m going to be taking a dramatically less formal approach to writing and editing, here. The spur of this decision:\nThe Bots Are Coming Have Arrived\nI don’t think that, ten years ago, anybody expected that the next dramatic economic shift would’ve been generative AI - specifically text-based AI - putting white-collar workers at the highest risk of automation. An example that comes readily to mind is the CGPGrey video Humans Need Not Apply, in which self-driving cars were offered up as the most readily-apparent example of economic risk of automation. This feels slightly silly with the benefit of hindsight - having started my engineering studies at around the same time though, it’s easy to forget how high-profile advances in self-driving were (at the time). It has become wildly, obviously apparent that the current frontier of automation has come, first, in the form of automated writing.\nThis is obviously a concern for many reasons. The internet is made up of a whole lot of writing. It’s how we text, how we tweet, how we email. It’s what we read, how we get our news, how we ask questions and how we find our answers. Before now, we could safely assume that something we read on the internet came from, at the very least, another human being.\nThat’s not the case anymore, and it will likely not be the case ever again. I don’t think this is the end of the world (probably. hopefully). I do think that this is the end of what I refer to as the statistical median of language: boring, sanitized, business-speak.\nFor the purposes of this note, I am going to refer to this type of language as GPTinglish.\nGPTinglish is a Dead-On-Arrival Language\nGPTinglish, to me, can be described in a few ways:\n\nIt’s Business English. Office English. [[content/notes/the-quest-to-slay-the-goblin#|LinkedIn™]] English. I hope, to those of you reading who have also worked a traditional office job, that you can recognize this shorthand as the type of thing that you’d find in your Outlook inbox;\nIt’s Boring English. It’s the median of the language, absent of all personality or human voice; and\nIt’s Bing-English. Meant to half-heartedly celebrate Microsoft’s role in solidifying what is very likely a self-consuming business model , poised to consume the very medium it was trained on, this is the type of English that we (currently) see from Bing Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others\n\nAbsent explicit directives on tone, you can find examples of GPTinglish on pretty much every single chatbot you could open at the moment. It’s informative. It’s to the point. Once you get the hang of it, it’s easy to both read and write. What’s not to love?\nAnd - unfortunately for the mediums that rely on GPTinglish - it’s wildly automatable, now.\nIn an effort to formalize the English language into a common median, we have all but guaranteed that the data used to train LLMs has, by definition and in practice, mastered it and put all of us that use it at risk of automation. We can also see the remnants of human efforts to curtail widely-used bots from going outside GPTinglish at their default settings:\n\nChatGPT refuses to generate even a generic list of English swears…\n\n…as does Raycast’s AI feature, which uses either GPT-Turbo-3.5 or GPT-4…\n\n…as well as Github Copilot, which makes a bit more sense…\n\n…as well as Bing Copilot, even with creative settings, which makes less sense.\nThe takeaway, to me, seems as clear as day.\nHumans Need Not Write GPTinglish\nThe market for GPTinglish is cornered. It’s been automated away. The need for writing in the median, devoid of voice or personality, has gone the way of horses in a world of cars. The onus for humans, then, is not to stop writing, but instead to write outside of the GPTinglish median.\nOne of my favorite examples of people who write with an inimitable voice is Kyla Scanlon, who frequently writes and records thoughts about macro-economics. What makes her writing engaging is not just thoughtful analysis of economic trends, but the voice in which she writes it. It was specifically her post on language and trust that spurred this note to turn into the length of an article.\nWhile I feel like the market for dry, median writing was already withered in the wake of a rising palette preference for infotainment, it was the the advent of ChatGPT and widely-available generative text that has thoroughly crushed the future prospects of GPTinglish as a human activity. While I can make no guarantees that generative AI won’t someday master imitation of human voice in writing - something that has already reared its head in generative images and spurred active efforts to curtail imitation and preserve unique styles), I have made a decision for my personal writing:\nI don’t want to write GPTinglish anymore.\nI find no joy in editing the way I write into a now-dead, median form of language, optimized for algorithms with its supply automated away by language models. I’d rather write in my own voice, with my own anachronisms and mistakes and weird vocal ticks and stray punctuation and weirdly-placed emoticons and deeply-nested parentheticals and… run-on sentences? Probably quite a few run-on sentences.\nAs far as I’m concerned, my responsibility is to ensure that the text is readable and that the points I want to make come across, even if it the occasional sentence requires a re-read.\nAnd if it’s not search-engine optimized, or tonally non-neutral, or long-winded? if it contains foul language?\n¯\\(ツ)/¯ fuck it.","date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/articles/hello-blog":{"slug":"content/articles/hello-blog","filePath":"content/articles/hello-blog.md","title":"Hello, Blog!

Even if it means spending twice as long over the course of a weekend, I will always try to find a way to automate away routine manual work.\n(All of the code used in this post can be found here.)\nToo much time to kill\nThis Monday, I started the last major semester of my undergraduate career. That’s right, folks - after six years, four program changes, and one brain surgery (which, in my personal opinion, is one too many), I will finally be wrapping up my degree!\nMy last two semesters will be my first part-time courseloads of my academic career, which leaves me quite a bit of extra time. Given that there’s not much to do during the quarantime, I took a bit of extra time to go over the top in a class I’m taking on operations and supply chain management.\nIntroducing: Littlefield\nAs part of the course, we’ll be spending four weeks in the operations simulation Littlefield. The premise of Littlefield is to tune parameters - things like orders taken and machines purchased - to optimize the profit of a simulated production line. The simulation itself runs a bit faster than real time. Over the course of five full calendar days, one session of the game simulates 250 days of work.\nIn the words of the course instructors:\n\nthe game is set up to give you the flexibility of checking it at your convenience (at any time of day or night)\n\nThe problem? I’m a walking dumpster fire when it comes to routinely checking on anything.\nMy email inbox is constantly full. I am always running on a quarter tank of gas.  I’ve never even kept a house plant alive for more than a week - I’m responsible for the early death of more succulents than I would ever care to admit.\nIn the honest-to-God words that my fourth grade teacher wrote on my report card, I am somebody who is “lazy to the point of efficiency.” If there is any way for me to put in all of the work up front, I will find a way.\nWeb Scraping 101\nAs somebody who has been lazy for 23 years now, I’ve become well-acquainted with the concept of web scraping. This is a method for accessing websites using a program instead of your browser. If your job ever involves going to a massive number of web pages and finding specific information - as a few of my internships have entailed from time to time - it’s a fantastic way to avoid the grunt work of going to each individual page by hand. For example, rather than employing an army of people to go through every web page on the internet and keep track of keywords, Google instead uses an army of web scrapers to do all that work for them.\nLittlefield, like the rest of everything on the internet, is scrape-able as well. The game is hosted on a web page that looks like this:\n\nWhile the page is different - and a bit harder to scrape - than your average news article or social media page, it’s still just a set of links that we can get information from. Each node of the graph above leads to a page full of data about the game. If were playing this by hand, we would log in a few times each day, open up each page, and see if there were any issues or bottlenecks in need of fixing.\nIt takes about five minutes to check everything - five exhausting minutes.\nInstead of taking five minutes to check this data myself, I have - as the rational person I am - spent the last six hours creating a program that can check it for me: the Littlefield Driver.\nThe Littlefield Driver\nThe Littlefield Driver is a program that takes all of the data about the state of the game - things like machine utilization, cash on hand, and orders placed - and compiles it into one data table I can look at, graph, and use to diagnose any issues that may be the case. The program is based on a 2017 project by Greg Lewis, who was (at the time) an MBA student at the University of Maryland. Lewis wasn’t alone - developer Jiayu Yi created an export kit for Littlefield back in 2017 as well.\nIdeally, my Littlefield Driver will have a bit of extra functionality beyond data export, but the spirit of automation is still the same. By the end of the project, the goal will be to let the Littlefield Driver use incoming data to automate machine production in the background, and maybe even send me a notification if (or when) something goes horribly wrong.\nThe first order of business for the bot is to take the structure of the game and represent it as a network graph.\nHere’s what the driver sees when it opens up the game:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lfdriver.draw_graph()\n\n\nIt’s… admittedly not very pretty. At the very least, though, it shows that the program is seeing what we’re seeing: the production line starts at the Orders &amp; Material menus, which goes to the first queue, which feeds into the first station, et cetera.\nHTML is the least romantic language\nWhen a web page is sent to your computer for your viewing pleasure, it’s sent as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML for short. Normally, we don’t have to deal with HTML directly. The entire point of your web browser is to read the HTML and turn it into something clean, pretty, and - most importantly - human-readable. Scraping the web, however, means that we do need to read the HTML directly in order to pick out the parts we want the computer to look for.\nOur target for the first round of web scraping is going to be the Littlefield data pages. These data pages give you the historical plot of whatever the selected node of the graph represents. For example, this is the data page for how many incoming job requests are received every in-game day:\n\n(as an aside, every time you open a data view, it annoyingly opens as an entirely new window, which means playing Littlefield often looks like this)\nI can always appreciate a clean-looking graph.\nTo make that graph, it’s actually your web browser doing all the work to turn the HTML into a neat visualization. This is what your computer is actually sent:\n\nEven when you’re making a website, reading through raw HTML is rarely ever a fun time. Thankfully, the data we’re looking for is on line 29, smack-dab in the middle of the page:\n{label: &#039;data&#039;, points: &#039;1 1 2 1 3 2 4 ...}\n\nThat’s the data that your browser is using to create the plot from the first image. It’s a bit weird that it’s all one line, but we can pick up from context that the data is being provided in pairs - the first number is the day, then the next is the datapoint - repeated over and over again. You could read it as:\nDay 1: 1 job\nDay 2: 1 job\nDay 3: 2 jobs\nDay 4: ...\n\nThankfully, the data is delivered in the same way for every single data page, from the orders received to the utilization of each station. All we have to do is write the code once, give the program all the data pages, and let it run. Instead of one string of data, we can tell it to put the data in nice, neat human-readable columns like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDayJOBIN112132425363\nAfter scraping every single page of data in the game, we can smash it all together and get a beautiful chart!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lfdriver.data()\n\n\nThis chart just shows the first and last 10 days of the historical data, and even from this we can gain some insights. S3UTIL, which represents the current utilization of the third station, is at 67% on Day 50 of the simulation. Judging by the rate of increase - roughly 1.3% every day on average - we should probably consider buying another machine at Station 3 prior to Day 75.\nOf course, that’s just an estimate. The purpose of the Driver is to check in on the game routinely to see if there are any critical issues. For example, the Driver can check to see if a station utilization is at a high percent and calculate whether or not it would be profitable to order a new machine.\nEverything is done - for now\nAt the time of writing this, I haven’t actually played a game of Littlefield - everything written so far was done on a static sample game. This means I haven’t had access to some features - like purchasing machines - so they haven’t been added to the Littlefield Driver… yet. Additionally, there’s some system variables - such as the cost of a new machine - that are available in the data but aren’t available in the Driver.\nUltimately, this is a god-awful way to play the game. With 12 years in development and only 2 examples (that I’ve found) of people attempting to automate the game, the game is clearly playable by hand. You might ask, then - why put in all this effort?\nThe real question is: why not?","date":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/articles/resume-ci-pipeline":{"slug":"content/articles/resume-ci-pipeline","filePath":"content/articles/resume-ci-pipeline.md","title":"Say Goodbye to Untitled (5) — GitHub Actions for Resumes","links":["content/notes/typst-resume-template"],"tags":["writing/tutorials","engineering/devops","projects/college"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  NOTE\n                  \n                \n\nThere are now way beginner-friendlier PDF markup languages to use, such as Typst. I wrote A new guide for the template here!\n\n\nAfter trying - and failing - to constantly keep my resume up-to-date in a dozen different places, I took a page out of the wild world of software development and found the solution: continuous integration.\nIt used to be the case that software would release in massive updates. A bunch of big changes, tweaks, and bug fixes would be shoved together in a tidy package and delivered out all at once. As development became faster, though, development teams created continuous integration pipelines to constantly push changes out to their users. Rather than waiting until the next big change to release patches, small changes could be pushed out automatically.\nThis is common in web applications like Facebook or Twitter. You’ll never see Twitter come out with some big new Twitter 2.0 (Two-tter) - any changes they need to make are just pushed out to users in small batches, over time. Why not do the same with a resume?\nCreating an Always-Updated Resume\nCreating a continuously-updating resume can be done in two steps:\n\nSet up your resume so that you can make small, quick, iterative changes over time; and\nFind a central place to send those changes to, and send viewers to that location.\n\nI’m sure there are quite a few ways to run those two stages. I personally chose Overleaf and GitHub. At this point, I had already been using Overleaf to format my resume and had been using GitHub for small odds-and-ends projects for the first couple years of my undergrad. If we’re being honest, I didn’t want to learn new things - I just wanted it to work.\nSometimes being lazy pays off. Not usually, but sometimes.\nIt also helps that Overleaf has a neat built-in GitHub integration. How nice of them to do that! With this integration, the steps for the project start to come together:\n\nCreate a resume on Overleaf\nPush your resume to GitHub\nCompile your resume into a .pdf file\n\nAlright - let’s do it!\nCreating a Resume in Overleaf\nFor the uninitiated, Overleaf is an application commonly used in academia to write academic papers in a programming language called LaTeX. If you’ve ever used HTML to create a website, LaTeX does the same thing for PDFs. Thankfully, to get started, you don’t have to create a new resume from scratch. Overleaf has a ton of sleek-looking resume templates that you can put your current information into. If you’re looking for a friendly resume-making guide, I made a starter template with explanations on a few best resume practices for students.\nOnce you have a template picked, you can select “Open as Template” to add it to your personal Overleaf projects. You can start putting your information in at your own pace, but it isn’t necessary to start connecting your resume to GitHub.\nLinking Overleaf and GitHub\nIf you don’t have a GitHub account, now is the time to make a new one! GitHub is a fantastic place to store and update code - it’s literally what it was made for! Because your new resume (and the LaTeX it’s made from) are very small, it’s an ideal place to host your resume.\nOn your Overleaf resume, you can find the GitHub integration in the menu on the top-left of the code editing window. After signing into your GitHub account, you’ll have the option to create a new code repository for your project. Choose a name for your repository, enter a description if you’d like, and then select the option to make your repository public.\nWhile you can name your code repository anything, I would recommend sending this to your user’s GitHub Pages repository. Every GitHub user gets a special place where they can host a website or files publicly at &lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;.github.io. If that type of address looks familiar, it’s because I host this blog on my own GitHub Pages site!\nIn order to use Github Pages, you’ll need to name your new repository &lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;.github.io. For example, because my GitHub username is spelkington, my GitHub Pages repository is named spelkington.github.io.\nFinally, with your repository made, click the button to push Overleaf changes to GitHub. Now it’s time to make your resume update automatically!\nSetting up Continuous Integration\nGitHub has a nifty feature called Github Actions that development teams can use to automate some of the pain-in-the-ass aspects of programming. Typically this involves automatically testing software for glitches or compiling code, but for our case we’re going to use it to automatically turn our resume code into a .pdf file.\nThankfully, we don’t have to come up with a way to do this ourselves! Xu Cheng has created a nifty GitHub Action that will compile LaTeX files into PDFs.\nGo to your new repository on GitHub and click on the Actions button at the top. From there, you can create a new action.\nCreating a new action should take you to a code editor where you can create an Action configuration from scratch. Remove everything and place this code below:\nname: Build LaTeX document\n \n# Run this action every time the resume .tex is updated\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - &#039;&lt;RESUME FILE NAME&gt;.tex&#039;\n \njobs:\n  build_latex:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n \n # Check out the repository on the Action machine\n      - name: Set up Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n \n # Compile the LaTeX document into a .pdf\n      - name: Compile LaTeX document\n        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2\n        with:\n          root_file: resume/&lt;RESUME FILE NAME&gt;.tex\n \n # Commit this change as an automated user\n      - name: Commit Change\n        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7.0.0\n        with:\n          author_name: &lt;YOUR NAME&gt; (auto)\n          author_email: &lt;YOUR EMAIL&gt;\n          message: &#039;TeX compile&#039;\n \n # Push the change to the repository\n      - name: Upload PDF\n        uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master\n        with:\n          github_token: $\\{{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nReplace everything in the &lt; &gt; brackets, press the “Start Commit” button at the top right, and you’re all set! From now on, whenever you make changes to your resume in Overleaf, you can navigate back to the GitHub integration menu, push your change, and it’ll automatically send the code to GitHub and turn it into a .PDF!\nSending Your Resume\nOf course, the point of all this is be able to have a single link to your resume that will stay up-to-date forever.

At 23 years old, that’s more than half my life. After picking up development again in 2021, I’ve had quite the walk through memory lane.\nBeing a dork is a lifetime commitment\nFlash back to 2007: Spencer Elkington, 4th grade extraordinaire. Oh, to be at my peak again. While I appreciate that secondary schools mandate that all kids have a well-rounded curriculum to introduce them to a wide span of different fields of study, I can safely say that one of my least favorite classes was art. While I didn’t not enjoy spending an hour cutting, painting, gluing, and molding, there are only so many burnt ceramics and skewed portraits I could churn out before they - and my parents to whom that “art” was gifted - realized that perhaps a budding patronage in the fine arts wasn’t going to be in the cards for me.\nRelated point: Being a dork might be genetic\nAround that same time, I made an account on ROBLOX, an online game platform that was just a year old in 2007. Founded originally as a physics engine by mechanical engineers, it transitioned into a gaming platform after (I can only assume) the founders decided simulating viable buildings was far less fun than blowing them up. One of the coolest features was ROBLOX Studio, an IDE for developing user-made games and content in Lua. If you could play a game, you could make a game, and that ease of entry introduced a whole generation - myself included - to the wild world of programming.\nCooking up small games for me and my friends is probably the closest I’ll ever get being an artist. I could never paint a canvas worth a damn, but in an increasingly digital world being able to write a bit of code lets you create as much as a paintbrush ever could. Always looking for ways to hang out with her son, my mom - who is and always will be the biggest, coolest dork I have ever met and will ever will meet - joined the platform in 2008 to make games too.\nWith a background in coding from her physics, geology, and chemistry studies at BYU during her undergraduate (because just studying one STEM field would be too easy, obviously), she was an artist of her own right when it came to making games her kids could play. Over time, one of those games developed into a project called Robloxaville that she actively developed on from 2008 to 2012. The game became one of the most played games on ROBLOX during that period, later superceded by a follow-on project called Lakeside that became one of the fastest-growing projects made on the platform within two months of its’ initial release.\n\nOriginal Robloxaville thumbnail, 2008\nThis success was in no small part due to a feature she developed in 2009 called Morph Magic, a wildly clever, wildly hack-y workaround she discovered to modify the underlying skeleton of the ROBLOX player model and transform players into fully-animated dogs, cats, giants, or any of a dozen other models. The ad-hoc rigging method originally used in Morph Magic was the only method for modifying the player skeleton until ROBLOX added official rigging support - six years later. Watching millions of people enjoyed my mom’s masterpiece is what made me get into coding - first as a play tester, then as a (very amateur) contributor, and finally remastering the project in 2017.\nLike I said: the biggest, coolest dork I have ever met and will ever meet.\nThe wild ways software can go horribly, horribly wrong\nIn 2013, my mom stopped developing on the platform. It’s not that she didn’t enjoy it - as a general rule, nobody in their right mind writes clever workaround libraries in their free time if they don’t enjoy it. What stopped her from developing on the platform was years of rampant client-side exploits made possible by some questionable decisions made in the development of the ROBLOX game engine. For the uninitiated, here’s what went wrong:\nWhenever you use a device connected to the internet - your phone, laptop, tablet, desktop, etc. - it is communicating with tons of other computers called servers that belong to whatever service you happen to be using. When you’re browsing the web, it’s communicating with web servers. When you’re sending an email, it’s communicating with email servers. And when you’re playing ROBLOX, it’s communicating with ROBLOX servers.\nThese servers are responsible for running all the code that makes the game work. It diligently reads the Lua code that makes up a ROBLOX game, line by line, and changes the state of the game to whatever its’ told. If you tell the server to game.Workspace.Player.Head:Remove(), it will gleefully read that line of code and promptly remove the head of some unsuspecting victim.\nThat being said, sometimes the server needs a bit of help. Specifically, the server will occasionally rely on the game clients - your computer, and the computers of every other player in the game - to help it run some of the physics calculations. The millions of physics calculations run by the game can be a real pain in the ass for one computer, so the game server needs all the help it can get. Because of that, the client will occasionally send some information to the server to help the server know what the state of the game should be. Innocent enough, right?\nIt wasn’t always the case that the server relied on the clients for just physics calculations. Back in the early days of the ROBLOX engine, the client could send the server any information about the state of the game and the server would happily accept it as a gospel truth, even if it wasn’t in the game code. Here’s how the conversations between the server and client used to go:\n\nCLIENT: Hey Server! I need you to remove this player’s head for me.\nSERVER: Are you sure? I don’t remember seeing game.Workspace.Player.Head:Remove() anywhere in the code.\nCLIENT: Yep! Definitely supposed to not have a head. That’s how it looks on my computer.\n\nAnd then the server would, once again, gleefully remove the head of some unlucky soul, despite that fact that it was a rogue player’s client who gave the order, not the programmer.\nThese exploits, at a basic level, allowed users to wreak havoc on games: breaking game functions, harassing players, et cetera. However, the exploits were not always just to be annoying. The same exploit that allowed users to mess with the state of the server could also be used to download the source code for entire games, allowing users to rip and reupload entire years-long projects in minutes. At their worst, these exploits could get downright horrifying. \nBack in the Saddle\nIn 2014 - following what could only be described as a complete COPPA cluster - ROBLOX began making moves to clean up and polish the platform. This came in two major changes to the way development worked. \n1. Filtering Enabled\nTo fix the slightly problematic client exploit issue, the company introduced the Filtering Enabled feature to their game engine. Filtering Enabled locked down what types of information game servers would accept from the game client and fixed that little whoopsies mistake made in the younger days of the platform. However, development became a trickier after this feature was rolled out - many older games needed to be re-made to conform to the communication boundary between the server and client, and required a bit more formal knowledge of game development to make.\n(For reference, I didn’t learn anything about server and client relationships until my third year into a computer science degree.)\nEven though this feature could be disabled to allow legacy games to keep functioning (and yes, Robloxaville is legacy now - it even has the Fandom Wiki page to prove it), ROBLOX’s featured games algorithm wouldn’t touch your project with a ten-foot pole for risk of traumatizing even more unsuspecting children. This was especially important for the next major change,\n2. Monetization\nThat’s right, folks - every line of code my mom wrote from 2008 to 2013, she wrote for free. Making fun games for millions of kids across the world, pro bono? That’s just the way Tiffany rolls.\nWith the introduction of the Developer Exchange (DevEx), anybody (who could afford a premium membership) could take the in-game currency generated from their games and exchange it for cold, hard cash. Funnily enough, in that original blog post explaining how the DevEx program worked, the company describes a system where:\n\n[A] power-user [could cash] cash out and [buy] a car to get to and from college – all from developing a popular game on ROBLOX. This is the kind of story we can’t wait to tell.\n\nThat’s not quite the direction things went.\nThe Part Where Spencer Does Some Math\nSince DevEx was released, I’ve heard stories of full-time developers leaving their jobs to develop on the platform. Success could be lucrative: Welcome to Bloxburg, one of a number of games that filled in the Town And City genre gap after Robloxaville and Lakeside became deprecated by the Filtering Enabled update, has been played 4.8 billion times as of writing.\nBillion. With a “B”. 4,800,000,000.\nThat’s a lot of zeroes.\nThe game offers users a premium pass as an in-game purchase. This is a pretty common way to offer users a bit of extra bang for their buck by providing small bonus features - Robloxaville did the same thing at one point. How much do you think they could make off of a feature like that?\nUnfortunately for us, exact numbers are hard to find. ROBLOX stopped showing how many times in-game purchases were sold, no doubt to stop people from snooping around at how much developers make. That being said, we’ll make an assumption off of Robloxaville’s conversion rates: For every 10,000 player visits, 5 people will splurge on a premium pass at a purchase rate of 0.05%. That doesn’t look too impressive - yet.\nAt a 0.05% purchase rate against - and I cannot emphasize this enough - 4.8 billion visits, we could estimate that BLOXburg’s premium pass has been purchased 2.4 million times. Each game pass is 400 Robux (R$), ROBLOX’s in-game currency. If memory serves, ROBLOX keeps 30% of in-game player-to-player purchases (because, as we know, the only certainties are death and Robux taxation). We can assume, then, that the developers of BLOXburg received ~960 million R$ for that premium pass.\nThat golden parachute is starting to look real good.\nWhat might a 960 million R$ payout look like? The current DevEx exchange rate as of writing is 0.0035 USD for every 1 Robux (Robuck?) at the time of writing. This means that the estimated worth of that one premium pass for that one game is…\n3.6 million dollars.\nHm.\nHmmm.\nOf course, this does not come without some caveats. First: this is one of the most played games in the history of the platform - its’ success is by no means descriptive of every developer. Second: their estimated payout was made over the course of the six years the game has been in development. Third: the BLOXburg team is not just a single developer, and they are very good at what they do - enviously good, even.\nThat being said: those caveats also come with caveats. Although not every developer is going to be that successful, ROBLOX self-reportedly spends about 25% of their revenue on developer payouts as of a report from 2017. Since the company made its’ public debut on the New York Stock Exchange and started reporting revenue as a publicly traded company, they reported a revenue of $147 million dollars in 2020. Assuming they still pay out 25% to developers, that’s a big ol’ pot of 34 million dollars to go around.\nHow To Make Games and Influence Gen Z\nThis post has gotten way, way longer (and included way more math) than I intended, so I’ll wrap it up for now. Long story short: since 2007, ROBLOX has grown beyond description in both size and sophistication. The introduction of monetization professionalized the platform beyond what hobbyists from the early 2010s could ever pull off today. And, after (attempting) to redux Robloxaville back in 2016, I’m ready to take another stab at it.\nThe way I see it, games are to the computer what film was to the camera and paint was to the canvas. It’s a way to create an experience that people can look at, play with, and grow from. I really enjoy it. It’s a way for somebody who has no business in making art to get pretty damn close.\n(And it wouldn’t hurt to get some of that sweet DevEx stimmie, either.)","date":"2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/articles/structured-streaming":{"slug":"content/articles/structured-streaming","filePath":"content/articles/structured-streaming.md","title":"Don't Double Down: Structured Streaming to Wrangle Data","links":[],"tags":["engineering/data","engineering/devops","engineering/languages/python","writing/tutorials","economics/finance"],"content":"Let’s say that you, a ✨ humble data plumber ✨ of the Big Data era, have been tasked to create an analytics solution for an online retail dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvoiceNoStockCodeDescriptionQuantityInvoiceDateUnitPriceCustomerIDCountry53636585123AWHITE HANGING HEA…62012-01-10$2.5517850United Kingdom53636571053WHITE METAL LANTERN62012-01-10$3.3917850United Kingdom53636584406BCREAM CUPID HEART…82012-01-10$2.7517850United Kingdom……………………\nThe analysis you’ve been asked for is simple - an aggregation of the number of dollars, units sold, and unique users for each day, and across each stock code. With just a few lines of PySpark, we can transform our raw data into a usable aggregate:\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n \ndf = spark.table(&quot;default.online_retail_data&quot;)\n \nagg_df = (\n  df\n  # Group data by month, item code and country\n  .groupBy(\n    &quot;InvoiceDate&quot;,\n    &quot;StockCode&quot;,\n  )\n  # Return aggregate totals of dollars, units sold, and unique users\n  .agg(\n    F.sum(&quot;UnitPrice&quot;)\n      .alias(&quot;Dollars&quot;),\n    F.sum(&quot;Quantity&quot;)\n      .alias(&quot;Units&quot;),\n    F.countDistinct(&quot;CustomerID&quot;)\n      .alias(&quot;Users&quot;),\n  )\n)\n \n(\n  agg_df.write\n  .format(&#039;delta&#039;)\n  .mode(&#039;overwrite&#039;)\n  .saveAsTable(&quot;analytics.online_retail_aggregations&quot;)\n)\nWith your new aggregated data, you can throw together a nice visualization to do… business things.\n\nThis works - right?\nAn ETL process like will work great for a static analysis, where you don’t expect the data to ever be updated - you assume the data you have now is going to be the only data you ever have. The problem with a static analysis?\nModern data doesn’t stop growing.\nWhat are you going to do when you get more data?\nThe naive answer would be to just run that same code every day, but then you’d be re-processing all of the data, every time you run the code. Each new update means re-processing data you’ve already processed before. When your data gets big enough, you’ll be doubling down on what you spend in time and compute costs.\n\nWith a static analysis, you spend money on re-processing data you’ve already processed before\nThere are very few modern data sources that aren’t going to be updated. If you want to keep your analytics growing with the source of your data, and save yourself a fortune on compute cost, you’ll need a better solution.\nWhat do we do when our data grows?\nIn the past few years, the term “Big Data” has become… lacking. As the sheer volume of data has grown and more of life has moved online, the era of Big Data has started to become the era of “God Help Us, It Just Won’t Stop Getting Bigger Data.” A good data source doesn’t stop growing while you work, and this growth can make keeping data products up-to-date a monumental task.\nAt M Science, our mission is to use alternative data - data outside of your typical quarterly report or stock trend data sources - to analyze, refine, and predict change in the market and economy.\nEvery day, our analysts and engineers face a challenge: alternative data grows really fast. I’d even go as far to say that, if our data ever stops growing, something in the economy has gone very, very wrong.\nAs our data grows, our analytics solutions need to handle that growth. Not only do we need to account for growth, we also need to account for data that may come in late or out-of-order. This is a vital part of our mission - every new batch of data could be the batch that signals a dramatic change in the economy.\nTo make scalable solutions to the analytics products that M Science analysts and clients depend on every day, we use Databricks Structured Streaming. Structured Streaming gives us the assurance that, as our data grows, our solutions will scale as well.\nUsing Spark Structured Streaming\nStructured Streaming comes into play when new batches of data are being introduced into your data sources. Structured Streaming leverages Delta Lake’s ability to track changes in your data to determine what data is part of an update and re-computes only the parts of your analysis that are affected by the new data.\nIt’s important to re-frame how you think about streaming data. For many people, “streaming” means real-time data - streaming a movie, checking Twitter, checking the weather, et cetera. If you’re an analyst, engineer, or scientist, any data that gets updated is a stream. The frequency of the update doesn’t matter. It could be seconds, hours, days, or even months - if the data gets updated, the data is a stream. If the data is a stream, then Structured Streaming is going to save you a lot of headaches.\n\nWith Structured Streaming, you can avoid the cost of re-processing previous data\nLet’s step back into our hypothetical - you have an aggregate analysis that you not only need to deliver today, but also keep updating as new data rolls in. This time, we have the DeliveryDate column to remind us of the futility of our previous single-shot analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvoiceNoStockCodeDescriptionQuantityInvoiceDateDeliveryDateUnitPriceCustomerIDCountry53636585123AWHITE HANGING HEA…62012-01-102012-01-172.5517850United Kingdom53636571053WHITE METAL LANTERN62012-01-102012-01-153.3917850United Kingdom53636584406BCREAM CUPID HEART…82012-01-102012-01-162.7517850United Kingdom………………………\nThankfully, the interface for Structured Streaming is incredibly similar to your original PySpark snippet. Here is your original static batch analysis code:\n# =================================\n# ===== OLD STATIC BATCH CODE =====\n# =================================\n \nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n \ndf = spark.table(&quot;default.online_retail_data&quot;)\n \nagg_df = (\n  df\n \n  # Group data by date &amp; item code\n  .groupBy(\n    &quot;InvoiceDate&quot;,\n    &quot;StockCode&quot;,\n  )\n \n  # Return aggregate totals of dollars, units sold, and unique users\n  .agg(\n    F.sum(&quot;UnitPrice&quot;)\n      .alias(&quot;Dollars&quot;),\n    F.sum(&quot;Quantity&quot;)\n      .alias(&quot;Units&quot;),\n    F.countDistinct(&quot;CustomerID&quot;)\n      .alias(&quot;Users&quot;),\n  )\n)\n \n(\n  agg_df.write\n  .format(&#039;delta&#039;)\n  .mode(&#039;overwrite&#039;)\n  .saveAsTable(&quot;analytics.online_retail_aggregations&quot;)\n)\nWith just a few tweaks, we can adjust this to leverage Structured Streaming. To convert your previous code, you’ll:\n\nRead our input table as a stream instead of a static batch of data\nMake a directory in your file system where checkpoints will be stored\nSet a watermark to establish a boundary for how late data can arrive before it is ignored in the analysis\nModify some of your transformations to keep the saved checkpoint state from getting too large\nWrite your final analysis table as a stream that incrementally processes the input data\n\nWe’ll apply these tweaks, run through each change, and give you a few options for how to configure the behavior of your stream.\nHere is the ✨ stream-ified ✨ version of your old code:\n# =========================================\n# ===== NEW STRUCTURED STREAMING CODE =====\n# =========================================\n \n+ CHECKPOINT_DIRECTORY = &quot;/delta/checkpoints/online_retail_analysis&quot;\n+ dbutils.fs.mkdirs(CHECKPOINT_DIRECTORY)\n \n+ df = spark.readStream.table(&quot;default.online_retail_data&quot;)\n \nagg_df = (\n  df\n+ # Watermark data with an InvoiceDate of -7 days\n+ .withWatermark(&quot;InvoiceDate&quot;, f&quot;7 days&quot;)\n \n  # Group data by date &amp; item code\n  .groupBy(\n    &quot;InvoiceDate&quot;,\n    &quot;StockCode&quot;,\n  )\n \n  # Return aggregate totals of dollars, units sold, and unique users\n  .agg(\n    F.sum(&quot;UnitPrice&quot;)\n    .alias(&quot;Dollars&quot;),\n    F.sum(&quot;Quantity&quot;)\n    .alias(&quot;Units&quot;),\n+   F.approx_count_distinct(&quot;CustomerID&quot;, 0.05)\n    .alias(&quot;Users&quot;),\n  )\n)\n \n(\n+ agg_df.writeStream\n  .format(&quot;delta&quot;)\n+ .outputMode(&quot;update&quot;)\n+ .trigger(once = True)\n+ .option(&quot;checkpointLocation&quot;, CHECKPOINT_DIR)\n+ .toTable(&quot;analytics.online_retail_aggregations&quot;)\n)\nLet’s run through each of the tweaks we made to get Structured Streaming working:\n\nStream from a Delta Table\n\n+ df = spark.readStream.table(&quot;default.online_retail_data&quot;)\nOf all of Delta tables’ nifty features, this may be the niftiest: you can treat them like a stream. Because Delta keeps track of updates, you can use .readStream.table() to stream new updates each time you run the process.\nIt’s important to note that your input table must be a Delta table for this to work. It’s possible to stream other data formats with different methods, but .readStream.table() requires a Delta table\n\nDeclare a checkpoint location\n\n+ # Create checkpoint directory\n+ CHECKPOINT_DIRECTORY = &quot;/delta/checkpoints/online_retail_analysis&quot;\n+ dbutils.fs.mkdirs(CHECKPOINT_DIRECTORY)\nIn Structured Streaming-jargon, the aggregation in this analysis is a stateful transformation. Without getting too far in the weeds, Structured Streaming saves out the state of the aggregation as a checkpoint every time the analysis is updated.\nThis is what saves you a fortune in compute cost: instead of re-processing all the data from scratch every time, updates simply pick up where the last update left off.\n\nDefine a watermark\n\n+ # Watermark data with an InvoiceDate of -7 days\n+ .withWatermark(&quot;InvoiceDate&quot;, f&quot;7 days&quot;)\nWhen you get new data, there’s a good chance that you may receive data out-of-order. Watermarking your data lets you define a cutoff for how far back aggregates can be updated. In a sense, it creates a boundary between “live” and “settled” data.\nTo illustrate: let’s say this data product contains data up to the 7th of the month. We’ve set our watermark to 7 days. This means aggregates from the 7th to the 1st are still “live”. New updates could change aggregates from the 1st to the 7th, but any new data that lagged behind more than 7 days won’t be included in the update - aggregates prior to the 1st are “settled”, and updates for that period are ignored.\n\nNew data that falls outside of the watermark is not incorporated into the analysis.\nIt’s important to note that the column you use to watermark must be either a Timestamp or a Window.\n\nUse Structured Streaming-compatible transformations\n\n+ F.approx_count_distinct(&quot;CustomerID&quot;, 0.05)\nIn order to keep your checkpoint states from ballooning, you may need to replace some of your transformations with more storage-efficient alternatives. For a column that may contain lots of unique individual values, the approx_count_distinct function will get you results within a defined relative standard deviation.\n\nCreate the output stream\n\n+ agg_df.writeStream\n   .format(&quot;delta&quot;)\n+   .outputMode(&quot;update&quot;)\n+   .trigger(once = True)\n+   .option(&quot;checkpointLocation&quot;, CHECKPOINT_DIR)\n+   .toTable(&quot;analytics.online_retail_aggregations&quot;)\nThe final step is to output the analysis into a Delta table. With this comes a few options that determine how your stream will behave:\n\n.outputMode(&quot;update&quot;) configures the stream so that, each time the code runs, the aggregation will pick up where it left off instead of running from scratch. To re-do an aggregation from scratch, you can use &quot;complete&quot; - in effect, doing a traditional batch aggregate while still preserving the aggregation state for a future &quot;update&quot; run.\ntrigger(once = True) will trigger the query once when the line of output code is started, and then stop the query once all of the new data has been processed.\n&quot;checkpointLocation&quot; lets the program know where checkpoints should be stored.\n\nThese configuration options make the stream behave most closely like the original one-shot solution.\nThis all comes together to create a scalable solution to your growing data. If new data is added to your source, your analysis will take into account the new data without costing an arm and a leg.\nYou’d be hard pressed to find any context where data isn’t going to be updated at some point. It’s a soft agreement that data analysts, engineers, and scientists make when we work with modern data - it’s going to grow, and we have to find ways to handle that growth.\nWith Spark Structured Streaming, we can use the latest and greatest data to deliver the best products, without the headaches that come with scale.\n\nThis post was written during my time as a software engineer at M Science as a joint project with Databricks.

Dan and Joseph, two of our other members, work for Sorenson Communications making video calling and other applications for the deaf community. We noticed that, for deaf students who would prefer live captioning in their lectures, there is no one-stop solution for both audio streaming and live captioning. We created Beethoven, an application for quick and accurate transcription in the classroom, to solve this.\nFunctionality\nPut simply, Beethoven will pair two devices together - an audio input and a screen output - and stream captioning from one device to the other in real time. The student can put one device at the front of the class for the clearest possible audio, and then position another next to them to read live captioning of the lecture and dialog as if it was the Closed Captioning on a television show or movie. This can either be done through Google Cloud transcription services or a live CART interpreter, depending on the level of accuracy desired and resources available.\nDevelopment Process\nThe application is split into three main parts - the audio input, the transcription service, and the screen output. First, the audio is captured by the audio input device. From there, it goes to either the Google Cloud voice transcriber, or a live CART interpreter. This happens through Google Cloud Services or peer-to-peer WebRTC, respectively. Once complete, the text will be sent to both our server’s backend to be compiled into a transcript and send to the screen output device, placed in front of the student, where a stream of the captioning is displayed.\nWhat’s next for Beethoven\nMoving forward, we’d like to fully implement the CART reporting features of the application. The P2P handshaking feature has a lot of improvements that can be made.

Back in my undergraduate degree, I learned about the phrase caveat emptor and caveat venditor:\n\nCaveat emptor means “buyer beware,” to be used in situations where a buyer of a product is responsible for understanding the risk they take in their purchase; and\nCaveat venditor means “seller beware”, to be used in situations where a seller of a product is responsible for minimizing the risk of the products they sell.\n\nA good napkin example would be a buyer and seller of digital LCD displays. In that case, it’s the seller’s responsibility to make sure that the display actually works - caveat venditor. However, what if a display works, but has a few dead pixels? This doesn’t render the display unfit for purpose - the seller would still be selling a good and usable product that fulfills their promise - but dead pixels are pretty annoying. The risk of dead pixels, then, may fall on the buyer - caveat emptor.\nOne of my intentions with Chaotic Good Computing is to contribute to the free body of knowledge I’ve benefitted immensely from myself, but to do so in a way that both fits my style and my habits better than traditional blogging or educational entertainment. The commitments that I’m making to you, the reader, are:\n\nTo my knowledge, the things that I’m posting are accurate at the time that I write them down; and\nIf I learn something in the future that corrects something I’ve written in the past, I’ll do my best to make corrections as I find mistakes.\n\nThat said, I’m also just some person on the internet. I know some things pretty well and other things not-so-much, with a pretty vast in-between. By the very nature of learning in public, some things here will be straight-up wrong, if not at least not-as-correct-as-they-could-be.\nSo, to you, I say:\n\nCaveat lector!\nReader Beware!\n\nand, as a follow-up piece of advice, I might also borrow from the Russian proverb:\n\nDoveryay, no Proveryay.\nTrust, but Verify.\n","date":"2024-02-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/digital-gardening-with-quartz":{"slug":"content/notes/digital-gardening-with-quartz","filePath":"content/notes/digital-gardening-with-quartz.md","title":"Breaking Ground on Digital Gardening","links":["content/articles/structured-streaming","content/articles/hello-blog"],"tags":["horticulture","engineering/languages/typescript"],"content":"I’ve decided that I’m pretty bad at capital-B Blogging™. The last “post” I made (as of writing) was the Databricks guest post on Spark Structured Streaming that I did back when I worked at M Science in 2022. That particular post went through a few different stages of revisions:\n\nRevising initial drafts as I learned more about Structured Streaming as a concept\nRevising “personally final” drafts with the Structured Streaming engineering team at Databricks\nRevising “technically final” drafts with somebody from our company’s internal marketing team to make sure I didn’t sound like a doofus/didn’t make it seem like the company hired doofuses (it hired me, so it totally did, but that’s obviously not something to broadcast openly)\nRevising the “marketing final” draft with a lawyer to make sure I wasn’t blabbing trade secrets to the general public\nRevising the “legally final” draft with Databricks’ blog team to make sure the formatting was right (which I didn’t do a good job of, apparently - the final published draft ended up having some weird formatting errors. Not totally sure what happened there ¯\\(ツ)/¯ )\n\nThat was quite a bit more than I’d expected when initially pitching “What if we published our internal guide for everybody?”. That, along with starting a new job that introduced me to a far higher standard for engineering, raised my own internal bar for “what should I put on the internet?” Since then, I’ve written quite a few posts that I’d describe as ~60% “done,” but didn’t end up hurdling internal (and arbitrary) bar for publishing.\nConsidering the editorial standards I started this blog with, the idea that I’ve had any bar at all is a bit funny.\nThe cost of learning is teaching\nAs somebody that has benefitted immensely from the free body of knowledge that exists on the internet, this doesn’t make me happy. A graveyard of posts I’ve arbitrarily deemed “unfinished” isn’t particularly helpful to anybody, including myself. Just because a set of knowledge isn’t refined enough to be perfectly, 100% clear to a broad audience doesn’t mean it wouldn’t be helpful to somebody, including myself in the future.\nI was fortunate enough to stumble on Maggie Appleton’s Ethos on Digital Gardening, which notably resonated with me more than many things I’d read in the recent past.

This’ll be a more concrete note on the concepts behind Event Storming/Domain-Driven Design, and my thoughts on phasing it in.\nColors/Terminologies\nWorkflow Atoms\n\n🟧 Domain Event:\n\nPast-tense Language. Understand the business, bridging definitions from problems to associated solutions.\nEvents being reacted to, hence past tense\n\n\n🟫 Actor:\n\nActual user being defined in the background. Sets role contexts, authorizations, capabilities by actual user.\n\n\n🟦 Command:\n\nAction made by actor to trigger the domain event. Many-to-one relationship with 🟧 Domain Events.\n\n\n🟪 Policy:\n\nConstraints on class constructors — conditionals between 🟦 Command and 🟧 Domain Events to determine if the state is in a position for the command to trigger domain event(s), or which domain events can be triggered.\n🟥 Hotspot:\n\nAttached to policies(?)\nSystem/API-specific 🟪 Policies related to non-internal-state issues, such as errors or unavailability.\n\n\n\n\n\nState Atoms\n\n🟩 Model/View: Actual data entries/tables representing the underlying state of the application\n\nSCHEMAS, not concrete TABLES. This is because model/view is also used to define responses from 💟 External Systems.\n\n\n💟 External System:\n\nExternal (non-app-owned) APIs. Backing data for a) 🟩 Model/View, providing the backing data from external APIs in a standard schema consumed by the application (NOT DIRECTLY BY WORKFLOWS) and b) vital for 🟥 Hotspots related to external API availability.\n\n\n\nMolecules\n\n🟨 Aggregate Entry:\n\nKeywords and terminology of aggregates. E.g. in e-commerce, “cart” is related to all of the individual workflows AND data for a given feature\n\n\n\nInitial Thoughts\nThe term “API surface” has been flashing around in my brain a lot lately, and this seems to be a nice way to describe layers of the application:\n\nAPI Surface:\n\n🟫 Actor defines users based on their roles\n🟧 Domain Event defines what the API should be able to “react” to\n🟦 Command represents what commands are available to trigger those 🟧 Domain Event reactions\n🟪 Policy entries define what actions from 🟫 Actor can be reacted to via 🟧 Domain Event based on the authorization, as well as state, of the application\n\n🟥 Hotspot seems to be a subset of this for error states\n\n\n\n\nInternals/Under-the-hoods:\n\n🟩 Model/View defines the actual data backing the application using strong schemas (three cheers for strong schemas!)\n💟 External System defines data/state retrieved through 🟩 Model/View that is not owned by the application (such as an external API) that the application has less control over, and must be accounted for with 🟥 Hotspot entries\n\n\nConceptual:\n\n🟨 Aggregate is used to “collect” all of the above into higher-level concepts\n\n\n\nPhasing\nUsing Event Storming for product planning breaks into distinct phases:\n\nChaotic Exploration: Define the surface purely by 🟧 Domain Event entries and 🟥 Hotspot entries\n\nThis feels slightly confusing, since 🟥 Hotspot entries seem to have a hard dependency on 💟 External System. Maybe it’s just general error states?\nIt seems like the use case for this — particularly phase 1 — would be for rapid note-taking during business meetings to try and define the shape of the user interaction surface. Basically, making sure that you and the folks on the business side have the same “shape” of the application before beginning even technical planning, never mind technical development.\nThe immediate Phase 1 hop from “What can this do” into “How can this fuck up” feels a bit cart-ahead-of-the-horse. That may be an initial knee-jerk reaction, so I’m going to roll with this for now until I’ve done it a few times before making a judgement.\n\n\nTimeline Enforcement: Ordering the Chaotic Exploration by the natural lifecycle of when events happen. Creating connections between 🟧 Domain Event entries that are placed in a logical order of ”🟧 X must occur before 🟧 Y”.\n\nI’m not sure if 🟥 Hotspot continues to play a “primary” role in this, and more that the timeline enforcement bubbles up potential timing issues (e.g. ”🟧 X must happen before 🟧 Y, so a Y→X would cause hotspot 🟥 Z to occur)\n\n\nCommands/Actors: Flesh out with 🟦 Commands and 🟫 Actors, namely how endpoints need to be declared, how they interact, and what will be necessary to complete a full feature.\nEntities: Group the workflows, logically, into domains via 🟨 Aggregates\nPolicies/Read Models: Work out advanced logic for 🟪 Policies, including authorization by 🟫 Actor role. Establish what schemas are necessary to satisfy the 🟦 Command requirements for each 🟨 Aggregate.\n\nPhasing session thoughts\nThe Phase 1 being 🟧 Domain Event and 🟥 Hotspot feels somewhat confusing. With the goal of speaking in real-world, shared terms with business folks, I feel that it’d make sense to go with 🟫 Actor and 🟧 Domain Event entries first, then going into Timeline connections for Phase 2, then going with 🟥 Hotspot for Phase 3.\nThe idea would be:\n\nBusiness Meeting: This is the portion where the business side and engineering side meet together to form the outer shape of the application. The goal is not to bikeshed implementation details (or for engineering to have strong opinions). The goal is to agree on the user-facing shell of the application, its capabilities, and its behaviors.\n\nPhase 1: Chaotic Entries (🟧, 🟫)\n\nGoal: Organize a barrage of high-level information from the business side. What is the goal of the app/feature? What should the user be able to do?\nThis provides a note-taking structure to user stories. Using 🟫 Actors and 🟧 Domain Events, you should be able to organize user categorize and what the users expect to be able to accomplish via 🟧 Domain Events\n\n\nPhase 2: Timeline Organization (🟧, 🟫, 🟥)\n\nGoal: Sort the 🟧 Domain Events into chronological stories, developing the full user stories.\nAs engineers, it’s good to understand that chains of 🟧 Domain Events that occur earlier will have simpler seed data (e.g. an empty cart) and that Events that occur later will require more complicated data with more failure points. This is where 🟥 Hotspots can be introduced. It is likely that 🟧 Domain Events further out will have more 🟥 Hotspots. The chronological ordering can help identify where, given a 🟧 Domain Event’s dependencies, where failure points could occur.\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up Engineering Meeting: Once the shape of the application is agreed on, engineering breaks out into a follow-up to come up with concrete implementation details. Largely the same as above.\n\nPhase 3: Commands: Figure out the actual API surface, constructed with 🟦 Commands with 🟪 Policies introduced to set up the advanced conditionals between 🟫 Actors executing 🟦 Commands and the 🟧 Domain Events they trigger. (🟧, 🟫, 🟥, 🟦, 🟪)\nPhase 4: Entities: Logical grouping of workflows into 🟨 Aggregates (🟧, 🟫, 🟥, 🟦, 🟪, 🟨)\nPhase 5: Tying up the necessary schema for the state of the application via 🟩 Model/View, and what is necessary via 💟 External Systems (and how these introduce new 🟥 Hotspots) (🟧, 🟫, 🟥, 🟦, 🟪, 🟨, 🟩, 💟)\n\n\n","date":"2026-01-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/hostage-negotiations":{"slug":"content/notes/hostage-negotiations","filePath":"content/notes/hostage-negotiations.md","title":"LLMs; or, How to Run Your Own Hostage Negotiation","links":["content/notes/digital-gardening-with-quartz","tags/horticulture/seasons/systems/"],"tags":["engineering/ai","writing/articles"],"content":"I remember watching CGPGrey’s Humans Need Not Apply back in 2017, when I was a freshman in college. At the time, I knew I was going into something related to programming (my major bounced around a few times in the first couple years of my undergraduate). Around the same time, I participated in the 2016 University of Utah hackathon, HackTheU, in which two forms of machine learning were all the rage:\n\nSelf-driving cars and mechanical automation — there were quite a few panels on this subject, although I’m not entirely sure why. The odds that a gaggle of undergraduates would crack that code given 48 hours and an irresponsible amount of Red Bull; and\nRecommender systems, which were fueling the general social media trend away from time-ordered feeds and towards systems that, today, we’d probably refer to as “For You” pages.\n\nIn hindsight, there was certainly a flavor of software engineering-elitism running rampant at the time. This was the era of #learntocode as a response to jobs being lost to overseas factories and automated assembly lines, of “software engineer” being the fastest-growing and highest-paying profession many years running, and of a massive increase in computer science majors — myself included — being trained through growing undergrad programs. The thought that, perhaps, a high-expense field of pure-digital-output wouldn’t be ripe for automation by — shocker! — digital automation, hadn’t crossed many minds.\nA bot can do your job. Now what?\nThere’s no shortage of fair criticism of LLM systems. These range from the conceptual (they’re probabilistic, and confidently make mistakes that can be hard to confirm) to the practical (they use an enormous amount of electricity, they can be built off of stolen intellectual property — the list goes on, really). In my particular line of work, it can be hard to express any opinion about AI without feeling like I’m expressing support for a technology that is, itself, holding our careers hostage. So, putting aside how billionaire-apologist, ecologically-irresponsible, and class-unconscious this sounds:\nLLMs can be better at humans than writing code, and not learning how to use it as a software engineering tool is quickly becoming a nonstarter.\nThere’s a lot of qualifications I can make to that statement, because it depends on a lot of factors. I won’t get into all of them, but the first qualification is that there’s a massive emphasis on “writing code.” I’m talking, very specifically, about the act of physically typing code into an editor. Especially with the adoption of agent tooling, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows for direct interaction with tools (like code editors themselves), it’s not even a close contest.\nSo — are we boned?\nI don’t think so. The biggest friction I’ve had in justifying that take to other engineers is trying to separate out the act of physically writing code into an editor and engineering — the act of designing systems to process information that don’t collapse under their own weight.\nIn trying to illustrate this distinction to people, I’ve cycled through a few different analogies:\n\nThere is a difference between designing a beautiful and functional building, and being the one to physically lay the bricks\nA good book and a bad book are both written using the same language — the difference is that a good book is narratively engaging and structurally sound.\nTomatoes won’t grow in a healthy way if you don’t provide a trellis for them to grow around.\n\nThe through line in all of these is abstract structures versus concrete implementations. The value of a human being is to ensure that this strange, non-deterministic, text-generating machine is surrounded by structures and mechanisms that push it in the correct direction.\nStronger Systems for Digital Gardens\nThe tomato plant/trellis is the analogy I’ve settled on the most — it reminds me of digital gardening. Human beings have figured out how to wrangle things we don’t fully understand for thousands of years, and reading LLM research and model cards can start to feel more like a natural science like biology than something like an applied math paper. We can prod a taught model to check its behavior, but for folks outside of the research side, it falls on us to accept that something we don’t fully understand can still be useful.\nWhat we are responsible for, though, is making sure that this new addition to our lives is handled with care. It’s on us to build systems for handling its use — there’s a long history of intentionally, and irresponsibly, introducing invasive species into our environments to solve one problem only to create a hundred more in its place. This is the distinction I make between engineering and the act of (*vomit*) vibecoding.\n2025 was the year AI agents really took hold, and I, like everybody else in this industry, have no shortage of stories about times where an agent completely missed the mark. The distinction I make, though, is that quite a few of them were my fault. Planting a prompt without having a strong system surrounding it to direct and validate the grown code always leads to issues down the road — but would that have been different if I grew that code myself? I likely would’ve made the same mistakes at a slower pace, save for a longer period of time to doubt my own decisions.\nIn working with agents, then, what systems can actually help? That’s been the core of this season of systems — working through what systems I can personally use, specifically for working with this tool, in this industry, to manage use of agent tools.\n\n\nStronger Architecture: It was surprising, in college, that concepts like design patterns weren’t specifically taught as a core part of the software engineering discipline in my program. I get that recommending any system of thought can elicit a whole lot of what-aboutism, but every field has certain patterns that can be taught as a starting point. Knowing how meta-structures in information systems interact with one another is pretty much non-negotiable — if you don’t go into a project with a strong sense of how the skeleton of the thing will look, it’s all too easy to let yourself — or an agent — grow the project into a corner down the line.\n\n\nAdversarial Tests: A massive upside of this industry compared to, say, the natural sciences, is that testing is incredibly easy. I can’t think of a single information processing project where there isn’t some way to benchmark if a change that you or an agent makes will make the project better or worse. We’re getting to the point where a lack of comprehensive, deterministic, routine testing to review your work is non-negotiable. If you don’t give the code some trellis to grow against, you shouldn’t be shocked when a project becomes worse by the time you close out for the day.\nAs an additional note — these tests should really be deterministic. I’m highly skeptical of any promise in the space of agent-as-a-judge or agentic code reviews. Having one LLM review another LLMs work feels about as fantastical as a strange hermit selling you magic beans that will grow a stalk into the clouds to a land of golden eggs. All you’re going to get is a load of rotten beans on the ground.\n\n\nAtomic Tasks: The thing that really seemed to catch the industry off guard is how, almost overnight, we became pseudo-managers of a fleet of agents writing code. Very little of a computer science education focuses on what many engineers find themselves doing far enough into their careers — managing other engineers. The skillset for engineering management is certainly a superset of the skillset of simply engineering. I’ve seen — and experienced, myself — a massive struggle around how to take a piece of software and delegate it out to dozens of smaller, discrete tasks. Many of the project management and delegation skills that an engineer may build up over a decade in the industry has quickly become a prerequisite to juggling multiple code generation sessions. It’s a rapid adjustment to folks in my position who, despite not being “junior” engineers, are still more junior than, say, a seasoned principal engineer.\n\n\nThis is what I’ve been able to come up with after a hectic year of rapid changes and adjustment. I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where there isn’t too much risk of, say, an Amazon-style engineering cull, but it’s still a nervous time in a shaken field.","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/kickoff-season-of-rhythm":{"slug":"content/notes/kickoff-season-of-rhythm","filePath":"content/notes/kickoff-season-of-rhythm.md","title":"Kickoff: Season of Rhythm","links":["content/notes/the-quest-to-slay-the-goblin","content/notes/over-under-engineering","tags/horticulture/"],"tags":["horticulture/seasons/rhythm","horticulture"],"content":"In the spirit of setting themes instead of resolutions, I’ve adopted a seasonal (or perhaps year-long - who knows?) theme for my own life:\nThe Season of 🎵 Rhythm! ✨\nDuring my Season of 🎵 Rhythm! ✨, I want to establish healthier cadences to how I spend my time day-to-day, and to be far more intentional with how I spend my time. This is largely a response to a broad problem in my life that I’ve felt for some time now.\nI am not a person who, at any point, has ever formed good, lasting, healthy habits.\nThrough high school, into college, and continuing into my adult life, I have always been a very “whichever way the wind blows” kind of personality. This hasn’t been entirely without its upsides. A coworker once described me as “very good to have in emergencies.” While I’d agree with that characterization, it’s because my tendency embrace The Goblin has meant I have been a co-conspirator to many of the emergencies in which I’ve learned to work well under pressure. If you do enough work, enough times, an hour before a deadline, you become very good at doing lots of work with hours before a deadline.\nThe downside to this is… fairly obvious. In the last year, I started working for and with a very emotionally healthy team of engineers who are remarkable at pacing themselves, doing diligent and level-headed work, and avoiding emergencies when possible - something that drove me absolutely insane at times during my first year. After having seen - and felt - how much healthier this environment is and how much more it can accomplish - particularly in collaborative and non-competitive settings - I’ve accepted it’s the way I’d ought to work, too.\nAs an additional downside to the way I worked, only having a cohesive and consistent pace of work meant that larger projects - things that aren’t done in one all-nighter but have to happen over the course of weeks and months - had a tendency to fall into obscurity. I’d attribute some of that to the way I have structured many of these projects, but constantly losing the thread between bursts of motivation means that bigger plans can easily turn into aimless wandering.\nSeason of Rhythm is a time to actively, rather than passively, establish good “rhythms” and routines that lower the variance of my own work and habits. The goal isn’t to shed the “works well in emergencies” characterization - on the face of it, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. However, where I’d describe the previous variance of my own ability to function personally and professionally as a 25-50% pace during “peace-time” and 200-400% pace during emergencies, I’d vastly prefer to even this out to something that doesn’t feel like personal and occupational whiplash: maybe 80% day-to-day and 120% during emergencies, as a vibes-y estimate.\nAfter two months, I’m on a really good track.

Like clockwork, he’d always put his keys in the same place. It varied from house to house, but it’s the most atomic example of a person with a system that I can think of: At X, do Y.\nI’m still working out, in my own mind, how this season will differ from rhythm — which has a review pending, I’ll get around to that sometime soon. The distinguishing factor in my mind, at the moment, is to review and restructure the way I operate, both personally and productively.\nSince the last post (in April of last year — never has 16 months felt longer), a whole lot has changed. I think that I, along with a lot of people in my own (or similar) positions, have suffered a bit of whiplash with how quickly the systems that grew over the course of decades shifted under our feet.\nAgentic Models\nGenerative AI has come quite a long way from simple chat interfaces. At that point, I think that folks (including myself) thought the primary shift would be what we, now, call AI slop. That’s still absolutely the case, but I find myself at the center of where AI, specifically AI agents seems to have found its most solid footing — software engineering and white-collar work. As these systems become more competent, it’s been a rapid rush to find what the human role in their use becomes.\nMy thoughts on this are… complicated, to say the least. There’s a lot at play, but within specifically those spaces I do find that it’s a net benefit.[^1] I’ve had this conversation with enough people at this point (family, friends, coworkers) that it’s almost canned at this point:\n\nFirst, the extent to which any person, myself included, utilizes this system is a constant negotiation with a lot of factors: how expensive the (good) models can be, how useful they actually are in a person’s line of work (the ceiling is very high in software development, depending on how you use them), how willing somebody is to “feed the machine”. These things have gotten really good, really fast (not sure what the current state of counting the rs in strawberries is), so not only does it need to be negotiated, but it needs to be renegotiated as the landscape changes, which has gotten pretty damn exhausting.\nAs the boundary of what work can be handed off to these systems shifts, my (or anybody else’s) role in work also shifts.\n\n^[1]: my biggest knock against LLMs? My writing uses an abusive amount of em-dashes, a habit that I picked up in college because it seemed to be an acceptable way to phrase connected thoughts, asides, or parentheticals that would otherwise be critiqued for being run-on sentences. LLMs have, for some fucking reason, decided to steal this habit out from under me, and now my writing looks less human, not more.

We really are in a golden age of diagrams, and I want this site to be the premier place to contribute as best I can to the era.\nIt’s not that I haven’t done my best so far — I’m particularly proud of the diagrams for, say, structured streaming and Gale-Shapley (and less proud of, say, supply chains or production engineering). What irks me is the lack of interactivity I’ve been able to give them — so far.\nInteractivity is an absolute boon. Really great visualizations — things that you’d see from, say, The New York Times’ What’s Going On in This Graph?, or the wonderful Red Blob Games — often come with the ability to highlight, explore, really touch the data. It’s not a hard pre-requisite — Our World in Data is an amazing visualization shop that outputs static graphs, no doubt because they share better on social media — but for a data-curious audience, nothing beats a tactile feel to the data.\nThe stopper is that these interactive diagrams are just plain harder to pop into a webpage. It’s easy enough to CTRL-C, CTRL-V an image of a graph into a webpage — it’s far harder to render the code in a way that isn’t a nightmare. Trying to get this working is the most common cause of death for the blog sites I’ve put together. The first Gatsby site, then the original Quartz run, followed by knock-on Gatsby 2, Astro, Gatsby 3, and — now — this site, here. It requires a lot of under-the-hood fuckery with the way the content is rendered. It requires strong systems that the rest of the site can be built around.\nBut now? I think I’ve finally got a pattern down! Without further ado: Quartz Widgets!\nInitializing Quartz widgets...\nInitializing Vault widgets...\nQuartz Widgets &amp; MDX\nOn the surface, the problem doesn’t seem too tricky to work around. Many sites are written using Markdown, which is a clean way to write formatted text without needing to worry about things like the frustrating interfaces of document software like, say, Microsoft Word. More or less, you can just pop open the literal Notepad app on your computer and just start typing — no setup required. It makes it easy to separate out the “run a website” part of the process from the “writing” part. Even this post is something you could download and read as a normal file.\nMarkdown has a lesser-known, still-delightful cousin called MDX. MDX’s goal is to have a foot on both sides of the fence: be primarily for writing, but have a bit of extra oomph under-the-hood to allow for website code to live alongside your writing. The problem? Just because something works with Markdown, doesn’t mean it’ll work with MDX.\nCutting wires, crossing fingers\nWe’re all pretty familiar at this point with the world wide web. You go to a website, it loads, you read it. You realize it’s AI slop, you go back, you try again — a modern twist. Over time, though, a lot of work has been done to make websites look, and feel, the way they do today. There’s a stark difference between something like the 1996 Space Jam website and your modern social media website.\nI’m no web historian. My understanding of the last, say, 3 decades of web development is:\ngraph TD\n    A[&quot;Website feels outdated&quot;]\n    B[&quot;Website feels slower&quot;]\n    A --&gt;|A new hack makes it feel better| B\n    B --&gt;|A new hack makes it feel faster| A\n\nThere’s a ridiculous amount of infrastructure in modern web development that can’t be seen at first glance, all dedicated to making everything faster so that you, the developer, can make things look prettier. This is what people are typically referring to when they use the term web framework — many slick hacks tied together to try and separate out “making a website” from “making a website that runs well.” It isn’t until you either need to speed things up, or add new core functionality, that you run smack-dab into all of the little hacks folks have come up with over the years sitting under the hood.\nQuartz, Hydration, and a Big Ol’ Postscript\nQuartz, the web framework that this site is built on, is fantastic. The premise is simple — if you use something like Obsidian to write your notes in Markdown, all you’ve got to do is plug it in and it’ll spit out a website for you. It’s got enough built-in configuration that, if your goal is to minimize the time between “I want to publish a website” and “I have published a website”, it’s an awesome way to go.\nIf you want to get real deep under-the-hood, though, you’ll need to go under the hood.\nThankfully, the documentation for Quartz (which uses Quartz — that’s neat!) is incredibly well thought-out. The architecture document is the place to go to figure out how MDX can be implemented. There’s a couple pieces from that documentation that flag trouble ahead:\n\nOn The Client:\nOnce the body is loaded, the browser loads the non-critical JS (emitted to public/postscript.js)\n\nIn context: when the website is built, all of the JavaScript code — the code that makes interactive things like the graph, explorer, etc. — gets shoved into one big file. For a normal Quartz site, this is actually an optimization! For things that will actually show up on every page, it means that the user’s computer only needs to download the script once. After that, every other page will load faster because all the code needed to run those are already saved to the user’s computer.\nThe rough part? This doesn’t give us a lot of wiggle room for per-page code. MDX’s whole thing is that you can include some code in one post to make it interactive. Following Quartz’s guide for writing your own components, all of the inline JavaScript for a component is gonna get tossed into that postscript.js and loaded when users visit your site for the first time — even if the user never actually visits the page your MDX component is on.\nThis Webpage: calculating...⏳Waiting for page resources to load...\nAbove is an MDX widget that will calculate the data your browser had to download to visit this page. There’s a few different categories of files, but the ones we’re talking about here are the postscript.js and Widget Scripts entries. That’s a live total (which will either be about the same, or much worse, than it is now). As of writing, though, I’ve got:\n\n(In case you didn’t believe me when I said all that stuff about everything behind-the-scenes that makes websites pleasant to visit: the Article entry is how much of this page contains the actual text of this post. Looking good takes a lot of data.)\nThe problem child, here, is the ratio between Widget Scripts and postscript.js . On the face of it, this isn’t too bad — a ratio of ~1:10 means the widgets for this page are pretty small.\nRemember, though — in Quartz’s out-of-the-box system, anything I put in here would always load when you first visit the website. An extra 20KB isn’t bad, but if I were to redo something like the Littlefield post with live graphs, those end up being about 50KB apiece. Publishing the graphs for the data behind flowthru and MagicAtlas will get up there in the ~3MB range.\nBlowing up the size of the postscript.js — effectively slowing down how long your site takes to load the first time — isn’t horrible on modern internet connections and device speeds, but it also isn’t good. The downside is twofold:\n\nPeople don’t like waiting for websites to load. On my current coffee shop WiFi (0.6 MB/s), the site takes a second to download, and then about three more to actually execute the code for the first time.\nSearch engines hate waiting for websites to load. That’s part of how they measure the quality of a site — and judge whether or not they’ll even show users your site in the coveted first page of search results.\n\nChrome’s Lighthouse utility is a good way to test how graciously the algorithmic overlords running our search engines will treat your site. For the actual Quartz website, the review is like we said before— not horrible, but not great:\n\nEvaluating the current performance of this site, though, show’s that I have already made this postscript problem worse with my changes to the Graph and Explorer components. From what I can tell, I caused an emulated Moto G Power commit suicide:\n\nWorkaround &amp; Results\nThe workaround I ended up going with — and I won’t get too far into it — was twofold:\n\nReplacing the underlying Markdown engine with remark-mdx as a new transformer plugin, which isn’t fun, but wasn’t bad.\nCreating two custom emitters — one for properly handling the conversion of the JavaScript in MDX files into web components that could be targeted by scripts, and another emitter to determine what additional widget scripts are necessary for a given page when the user clicks on it.\n\nIf this system feels like it works without a whole lot of maintenance, I may contribute it back upstream to the original Quartz project if folks seem interested. Obsidian is admittedly not the friendliest for MDX files — before gauging the upstream interest, I may accompany this with a more up-to-date Obsidian MDX plugin.\nIn case this does end up upstream at some point, this system has two parts in my actual code:\n\nQuartz widgets, which are built into the actual quartz engine, for things that seem universally helpful like inline PDF viewers (similar, but not as custom, as the components used for annotations).\nSite widgets, which live in the actual Obsidian vault, and are custom to my website.\n\nThe short widget guide, as well as the longer architecture evaluation, have more details on the source code implementations.\nNext Up\n↻\n(Preview of the Game of Life widget for the published version of a friend’s dissertation.)\nI’m super excited to have a solid platform that helps get things looking, and feeling, like I intend.

Not “completed”, since that’s an irrational way to think about projects.\n\nLooking back at periods of my life, I feel like my follow-through rate on projects was highest when I was 12 years old. At that point, my “projects” were:\n\nMy grades in high school\nWriting shitty programs on my TI-84\nWriting small games on Roblox\n\n13 years is long enough ago that, for the sake of simple math, my follow-through rate was 100%. Gee, what a reliable kid I was!\nI can name 4 periods of my life where the amount I learned about engineering grew at a more-rapid-than-usual pace:\n\n2016: I began studying computer science in my undergraduate\n2018: In trying to build up my resume, I started taking writing open-source and release-able projects more seriously\n2020: I got my first full-time job as a data analyst/software engineer writing data pipelines in Python and Spark\n2023: I got my second full-time job writing general software in index, with incredibly smart capital-E Engineers™ that were also incredibly good mentors\n\nWhile it feels great to know more, learning has caused me a fundamental issue: it’s easier to be bad at something on accident than on purpose.\nI’ve increasingly noticed myself trying to apply the things I’ve learned to new projects, causing a whole lot of up-front work to get a project started. Putting yourself in a prison of making the “best” choices at the very start of the project is incredibly demotivating and absolutely tanks the odds that a project started will someday be a project finished. Ironically, it’s future-proofing for a future that doesn’t happen.\nLet’s say, hypothetically, that my project follow-through rate started at 100% and dropped by a third following each learning period. After 4 learning periods, that would leave me at…\n(1.00 - 0.30)^5 = 0.16\nYeesh. 16% follow-through rate sounds rough, but when I look at a recent history of what I’ve accomplished versus what I’ve wanted to accomplish, the number seems somewhat reasonable.","date":"2024-02-25T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/periodic/daily/2024/02/2024-02-25":{"slug":"content/notes/periodic/daily/2024/02/2024-02-25","filePath":"content/notes/periodic/daily/2024/02/2024-02-25.md","title":"Rhythm: Day 1","links":["contact","content/notes/periodic/daily/2024/02/2024-02-26","content/notes/digital-gardening-with-quartz","content/notes/over-under-engineering"],"tags":["horticulture","engineering/languages/typescript","horticulture/seasons/rhythm","private"],"content":"This note is part of my private vault, and isn’t published publicly on the site or within the public GitHub.\nIf you are interested in what this note contains, please reach out to me!

One issue I’ve run into - especially during a particularly tumultuous US election year - is a tendency to check the news.\nAnd then, five minutes later, check the news again.\n…and again\n…and again.\n\nI talk a lot in this post. You may want to skip to the useful part.\n\nI’ve rationalized it for awhile by saying “I work in politics - of course I should stay up to date!” However, that’s a lie - my day job is not in politics. At best, It’s working on software adjacent to people who are adjacent to politics.\nTo alleviate that for awhile, I had used a Chrome-specific app called StayFocused to block a pretty broad swath of websites, but ran into two issues:\n\nStayFocused allows you to schedule blocks, but only for predetermined amounts of time, and only a single block per day. This was not quite as flexible as I was comfortable with - I do like to check the news, my email, or Bluesky at lunch, or if I get off of work a bit earlier than expected.\nI started using Arc Browser with three different profiles - Personal, Work and CGC - and each one has its own Chrome plugins. Because of this, I’d have to configure/reconfigure/update the StayFocused installation in triplicate, which due to the way their app is set up is incredibly hard to do.\nTheir app kept hijacking my browser to notify me of updates, and I didn’t see a readily-available way to do that. Ironically, this had the effect of absolutely shattering my focus.\n\nI ended up uninstalling it and going with something a bit heavier-duty. SelfControl is an application for MacOS that blocks out apps across the entire operating system. I had also seen Focus listed as a possible solution, but… $49? For effectively the same thing with a prettier interface? yeesh.\nIronically, though, SelfControl requires self control to use, which is exactly what got me in this situation to begin with. It is incredibly easy to “take a break” and then just-a-couple-more-minutes yourself out of any semblance of flow. As a nice surprise, though, SelfControl comes with a CLI, which means we can use it for some more advanced workflows! We can use this to do two things:\n\nSchedule blocks of self-control for the future, e.g. “In 10 minutes, I will focus for 50 minutes”; and\nConnect that behavior to Raycast, which will help us lower the bar to starting Raycast (as, admittedly, having to swipe back to the main Mac desktop is a pain in the ass and puts it out-of-the-way)\n\nThe Useful Part\nI’ve added a couple of useful bash scripts to a SelfControl Raycast Plugin for others to use. At some point, I’ll look into the process for getting them added to the actual Raycast extension store. You can add these by cloning the repository and adding it in the Raycast settings as a “Script Directory.”\n\nTHAT BEING SAID: I’ve used the term caveat lector quite a bit to warn people that I’m just some guy. This goes doubly here! This is software that has literally only been tested, by me, a handful of times, that I made while (ironically) procrastinating other things I should be working on. To say it isn’t well-tested would be a dramatic understatement. The creators of SelfControl warn that it’s a tool that, if misused, can have side effects. So to that end… what would the phrase even be?\n\nHuh.

Due to some [[content/articles/robloxaville#|pretty glaring security concerns]], a project started over the summer of 2017 to remaster Robloxaville. I’ll be the first to admit that the remaster is substantially less fun to play than the original. While part of this constraint was time - the original was made over the course of ~4 years, while the remaster was made in ~3 months - it’s undeniable that the velocity of the original project was simply far higher because it was under-engineered.\nThe original project was largely made by my mom, who studied programming during her physics-chemistry-geology triple(!!!) major in college, with some tangential work from me, who was a literal child. Not to sell short the sheer amount of work she put into the project, but between a lack of formal software engineering and the pretty glaring shortcomings of the Roblox engine itself meant that, frankly, it would’ve been impossible to engineer any of it properly to begin with. By the time the summer of 2017 rolled around and the remaster started, two circumstances collided:\n\nPlatform developers were now being paid, which introduced a far higher bar on quality of work being done\nI had just finished my first semester of a degree in computer science and learned tip-of-the-iceberg concepts of what constituted “good” software.\n\nDespite happening 7 years ago as of the time of writing, I remember how absolutely stressful that summer was. I spent wasted a lot of time worried that the code I was writing wasn’t engineered enough, and ended up designing a lot of bad and convoluted systems meant to save myself time in a future of development on that project that never came.\nThere exists a graveyard of projects and posts between 2017 and today that have fallen victim of arbitrary bars for under-engineering that I’ve put on my own work.","date":"2024-02-25T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/scratch/brevity":{"slug":"content/notes/scratch/brevity","filePath":"content/notes/scratch/brevity.md","title":"brevity is no longer the soul of wit","links":["contact","content/articles/binglish"],"tags":["horticulture","private"],"content":"This note is part of my private vault, and isn’t published publicly on the site or within the public GitHub.\nIf you are interested in what this note contains, please reach out to me!

To that end, there may be better alternatives for this that would both be less of a lift (as the code/process is already written) and get a more accurate test of validity against AFT infrastructure.\n\n\nFunctionality:\n\nThere is no question that we would need to buy into the full Pro version ($70/user/month) to get close to emulating the particular services we’re interested in — namely, critical pieces such as Cognito.\nBeing able to quickly test in LocalStack’s Pro version wouldn’t negate the cost we would need to also test these pieces on actual AWS infrastructure. In effect, we’d be double-paying for a partially-emulated environment.\nThe alternative to this may be to continue focusing on end-to-end testing in the already-existing AWS development environments, allowing us to programmatically test on infrastructure that (should ideally, with AFT) be a near-direct mirror of the application production environments.\n\n\n\nHashicorp Demo Video\nDemo Section\n\nSPIKE Reference: HashiCorp Deploy\n\nTODO\n\n\nDemo for a lambda reading into an S3 bucket\nApplication for AFT would need to be in multiple steps — particularly, global customizations into account customizations\n\nEnvironment would need to preemptively load an additional layer for the account request resources, but this should be trivial - would need to be starter account system variables in [TODO: SERVICE NAME]\n\n\nGoes over the particulars of the infrastructure they’re attempting to deploy - should be arbitrary, but we’d want to set up a specific test account for our purposes. sandbox is comin’ back, baybeeeeee\nSPIKE Reference: LocalStack Docs\n\nTODO\nLocalstack extensions (labelled alternatives in the docs)\n\nThis seems to reference a docker compose system, which makes sense, since AWS is made of a bajillion different services. This might be the approach, as we realistically only need the 6-7 services that we tend to use (+ dependencies for those services)\n\n\n\n\nDOCKER COMPOSE\n\nDebug level to see output - requires passthrough of docker socket and a localstack local volume\nTODO: Mermaid graph of interaction between local terraform instance, LocalStack docker stack, actual AWS account\nNOTE: The concern I’d have is the frequency at which AWS updates and cadence at which LocalStack would update alongside it. I would have concerns about having tests passing here as a hard requirement for merging in a PR.\n\nThat said, this would still be invaluable as both a local development tool and a canary-in-the-coalmine with incoming deployments.\nSPIKE: Broadcasting non-blocking warning outputs in GitHub Actions\n\n\n\n\nGoes in-depth on a practical example, not necessarily needed.\nAWS SERVICE FEATURE COVERAGE:\n\nThis lends itself to the amount of drift between LocalStack and AWS itself - thankfully, they seem to be documenting this well.\nConsidering this video was released 5 months ago, I doubt this has halted development.\nCommunity and Pro Versions\nLocalStack Actions Integrations\n\n\n\nTAKEAWAYS:\n\nWe would likely go with the Docker Compose version, selecting specific services to use.\nBecause we have the additional AFT layer on top of our “vanilla” terraform, there will likely be “degrees of correctness” to using this in our workflows:\n\nBRONZE: In the Customizations repository, we add the infrastructure to locally test a given account customization directory, adding a Compose file to each to declare which services the account actively requires.\nSILVER: We pull in the requests and global-customizations repositories, emulating the general “pipeline” that AFT provides us by applying the layers in the same order AFT would when we deploy a new account\nGOLD: We emulate (or more likely, see if somebody else has already tried to emulate) the Account Factory Terraform setup process, likely running two stacks: one for the AFT account + pipeline, and the other for the “new” account.\n\n[I] Hold your horses: What if we created a “pure” LocalStack docker stack, applied the original Account Factory Terraform .tf file to that, and then just… built that into an image?\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to emulate the target test account as-is may not be feasible - in essence, setting up the LocalStack would only emulate a from-scratch deployment. Not necessarily a good or bad thing — just a consideration.\n\nLocalStack Docs\n\nQUESTION: Does LocalStack offer good support for the services we use?\n\nNOTE: The two levels of emulation they offer are CRUD for response-only, and Emulated for actual logic emulation.\nNOTE: Some services are locked behind the Pro version\nSUPPORT LEVELS:\n\nRDS (Databases): **, Emulated\nCognito: Locked in Pro, variable support\nUser Pools: **-****, CRUD\nVPCs: ***-****, CRUD\nECR: Locked in Pro, variable support\nELB: Variable, v1 as ***, CRUD, v2 as Pro feature\nKey Management Service: Pro\nLambda: Pro\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to pause here before researching any further. It appears that the cost here is $70/user/mo for LocalStack pro, and many of the services we’d hope to use it for appear to be locked in the Pro version.","date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/scratch/the-best-side-of-the-road":{"slug":"content/notes/scratch/the-best-side-of-the-road","filePath":"content/notes/scratch/the-best-side-of-the-road.md","title":"What is the best side of the road to drive on?","links":["contact"],"tags":["horticulture","private"],"content":"This note is part of my private vault, and isn’t published publicly on the site or within the public GitHub.\nIf you are interested in what this note contains, please reach out to me!

However, if you google the above, you’ll run into lots of posts of people who hear a handful of beeps when their LCD display is disconnected, signifying that the POST process didn’t complete. This will absolutely fuck you over if your laptop manufacturer is one of the many who have this check in place.\nWhile I believe it is possible to do this on a PC (not a Mac, where slabtopping has been documented extensively), I personally ended up frying the motherboard after about 5 hours of cutting away at the stupid fucking thing.

It’s not something that I’d ever seen in the science portions of my undergraduate. As I’ve entered into industry and more frequently both use and participate in the development of a broader range of software, there has been a sharp increase in frequency that I’ve seen this term:\n\n[Proper noun] is an opinionated [general noun]\n\nWhat… does this mean? I’d never seen it in an academic slide deck before, but I can name a few high-profile instances of the label used. While it’s usually surrounding frameworks, I’ve seen it used in other places as well:\n\nThis note ended up having a lot of front-loaded context — feel free to skip to the point\n\n\nDuring C# related work — I have previously used Wrapt as a index web API scaffolding tool, which describes its default options as opinionated\n\nOn wandering through the chain of opinions, Wrapt’s opinions are, in turn, based on the Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) opinions I’d first seen in Jimmy Bogart’s post on VSA, a recommended must-read by my team at NWYC\n\n\nDuring index-related CGC work: “Flamework is a highly opinionated game framework”\n\nInterestingly, this description has since been replaced to say (as of writing) “Flamework is an extensible game framework.” — thought I was going insane in trailing back after seeing that phrase there months ago and not finding it, but a stale Google Index reference shows that I’m not crazy (on this one, at least). I am curious about the onus behind the wording change, because I do actually believe that the new description better captures the intent of the Flamework package.\nUPDATE: After talking to the creator of the package, this change was made as the project evolved from a personal single-user project to a broadly-used staple of Roblox/TypeScript development. In particular, the Modding API is what spurred the description change, as it allows an end-user to yoink very nifty behavior like dependency injection and decorators and attach it to custom utilities.\n\n\nStumbling on the black python formatter while wrangling Databricks codebases at M Science\n\n\nThis is probably the most severe(?) case of opinionated software I’ve ever seen — it is literally named after the Henry Ford quote regarding available paint jobs for the Model T: “Any color the customer wants, as long as it’s black”\n\n\nThe black repository is also home to one of my favorite GitHub Issues of all time, in which a senior staff engineer at Twitter requested the ability to configure 2-space tabs instead of 4-space tabs.\nThe response to one of the most influential tech companies to ever exist requesting a (seemingly) minor change in order to adopt it as the standard code formatter for their entire Python codebase was a resounding: “no.”\n\n\n\n\nAnybody who has ever seen highly-opinionated flame wars in the comments of Reddit threads, Stack Overflow posts, or — frankly — between any work call between more than, say, two engineers in the same field, opinions have the potential to run very strong.\n(Want a real life example? Go ahead and pop “is &lt;PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE A&gt; better than &lt;PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE B&gt;?” into your search engine. One of my strong opinions is that 99.9% of those conversations are bullshit, wasted time. Seeing them in the wild makes me want to close my laptop and walk into the ocean, my final thought before the air depletes from my lungs being that, at the very least, my decomposing body will contribute more back into The Universe than those people did by arguing complete fucking nonsense on the internet.)\nWhen strong opinions collide, it can feel very much like watching an unstoppable force hit an immovable object. Especially when I was a data analyst on the way up to software engineering, I often found myself a junior (and rightfully silent) participant in long-winded, fruitless, and ultimately destructive conversations, in which two parties who hold strong opinions talk past each other for… 10 minutes… 20 minutes… an hour? with the call ultimately ending because one side or the other has to hop into a different call of the same flavor.\nI think the way we can all occasionally approach having an opinion — or not having an opinion — is ultimately reductive, destructive. It slowly chisels away, bit by bit, hundreds of thousands of minutes, hours, and days of human life to the behest of our goals yet delight of the Reaper himself.\nThe Point\nI’m proposing, here, a way to:\na. properly classify your opinions; and\nb. how to use those classifications to lead legitimately constructive conversations with others\nLately, I’ve been trying to put my own opinions into one of two categories:\n\nStrong Opinions: Opinions that I have built up over time and experience, and that I feel I have a compelling case for that clearly communicates the full scope of costs and benefits to the decisions that opinion leads me to propose\nWeak Opinions: These are the ones that I have that are built on sub-par information, that I can’t clearly communicate, or that are generally based on ✨ vibes 🌈\n\nWhen contributing to a conversation or argument on a topic, I’ve been trying really hard to ask myself: “Is the opinion I’m about to state a strong opinion?”\nHaving a weak opinion on a topic doesn’t necessarily mean it shouldn’t be mentioned at all. It does mean that it’s likely a point that, should somebody else have a stronger opinion, that opinion isn’t a hill I should consider dying on.\nThat said, having a strong opinion also doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something I ought to be doubling (or, god forbid, tripling down on). Especially when in a conversation with more senior engineers — which, at the current stage of my career, is vastly more likely — a strong opinion is one in which I ought to present my best case, rationale, and analysis in the hopes of reaching consensus.\nEven if my case for one of my strong opinions fails to reach a consensus — or even convince anybody, which does happen (sometimes a lot) (most of the time) — that isn’t failure. Ultimately, as I’ve gotten further into my career and seen a broader range of opinions reach a broader range of success or shortcoming, my approach has ultimately fallen back to:\nThe best side of the road to drive on is the side everybody else has agreed to drive on.\nNo matter how strongly you might feel one way or another, never underestimate the power of consensus. Either way, the outcome of accepting consensus is positive:\n\nYour opinion ended up being the way to go in hindsight, and you’ve gained experience to make a better case the next time it comes up; or\nThe consensus opinion goes perfectly fine, you achieve your goals, and have gained experience on which you can build new, better-informed opinions.\n\nA final open letter\nI’ve noticed, in working with others, that the above classifications can somewhat freak people out — especially if they’re used to working with Strong Opinion People™, because how quickly I’m willing to roll over on my weak(er) opinions has the potential to come across as misunderstanding or apathy.\nAs an open letter to people in the future that see me do this, I make you this promise: when I quickly fold on an opinion, it is far more likely that — in that moment — I feel there’s more value in reaching a consensus and moving forward with any opinion than trying to force through a bad argument for a strong argument or a null argument for a weak one. At this point in my life, I am more interested in making progress than being right.","date":"2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/supply-chain":{"slug":"content/notes/supply-chain","filePath":"content/notes/supply-chain.md","title":"What *are* Supply Chains, Anyway?","links":["tags/engineering/data/","content/notes/caveat-lector","content/notes/qamo","contact"],"tags":["economics/finance","engineering/languages/python","engineering/data","projects/college"],"content":"Below, you’ll find some graphs.

As much as I would like to say they’re not too bad for a first attempt, they don’t “speak for themselves” as much as they “scream torments in the face of the viewer.”\nThe below graphs are stock tickers, connected to one another by their supplier relationships. For example, if Company A publicly noted that they received supplies from Company B, that would be denoted by a connecting edge.\n\nBelow is my first (and only) attempt to organize the above output. If I’m recalling correctly (and this was in 2019, so caveat lector), this was at least an attempt to get the first-order to third-order suppliers of a given set of equities and place their order in shells around the center. It’s messy, it’s noisy, and frankly, incomprehensible.\n\nThe hope of this analysis was to ultimately connect supply chains and, as a secondary goal, find graph cycles among a set of target stocks to find and catalog “supply loops”, and see if stocks in a given supply loop rise and fall together.

The Goblin makes me sad. The Goblin stops me from doing the things that make me happy. Every day, I have to actively re-remember how much I hate The Goblin, and how much happier I am when it’s gone, so I try my best to kill The Goblin.\nI also hate the word “productivity.” There’s a sort of LinkedIn-centric slice of society that has built up the neutrality as an honest days’ work as a divinely-capitalized entity: Productivity™. It elicits (in me, personally) the visceral feeling I get when I see hustle-culture, rise-and-grind, success-is-a-choice-and-failure-is-your-fault types - the ones that farm for engagement by repeating gross approximations of quotes from self-help books that have been Human Centipede’d from one hustler to another. \nThat being said - productivity tools are some of my most reliable Goblin-slaying weapons.

It is now also used for Chaotic Good Computing professional development mentoring &amp; consulting. You can find more resources at blog.chaoticgood.computer\nIf you have any questions, feedback, or advice, please feel free to contact me at spencer@chaoticgood.computer\nIf you publicly post or share the source code to your resume, you’re totally allowed (and I would encourage you) to delete all of the commented sections in the template.\nQuickstart: How to use this template\n\nIf you haven’t already, create a (free!) Typst account at typst.app\nOnce you have an account, go to Typst Universe and select the CGC template\nClick on “Create Project in App”, give your project a title, and press “Create”\nStart editing! This copy is your own personal copy to edit however you want!\n\nIf you would like to edit a copy of the resume without the guide, use the resume.typ file.\n\n\n\nOpinion: Why should you use this template?\nThis template will handle 99.9% of your resume’s formatting for you so you don’t have to spend time massaging the formatting in an editor like Word or Google Docs, or worry that the template you’re using doesn’t mesh with the jobs you’re applying for. Having the formatting pre-baked means you can take more time to focus on your content - easily the most important part of your applications.\nTo be clear: the formatting here is OPINIONATED. Although the format has been refined over a period of about 4 years based on a number of meetings with recruiters, hiring managers, and employees at both small and large companies across a number of technical and professional industries, it does still represent many of my own opinions. That said, it’ll provide you with a good starting point to work off of as you slowly develop your own resume &amp; style moving forward.\nIf this is your first resume, I’d recommend sticking with this formatting for now. However, if you’re either recreating a previous resume, or if you get far along enough into your career that you want to flavor it up a bit, you can find all of the templating in the resume.typ file included in this project.\nBasics of Resumes\nIn general, resumes ought to be one page of concise, bulleted, well-formatted descriptions of things about yourself and things you’ve done that explain who you are and what you can do to somebody who’s looking to hire somebody like you.\nWhile there are exceptions to the one-page rule (which would make it a CV, reserved for people with Ph.Ds and many publications, or those with decades in their field and significant and notable achievements), you should keep it to one page. Having more than one page on your resume will lead to one of two likely reactions:\n\n“This person clearly didn’t need to use two (or more) pages”, which immediately shifts the reviewer to a mindset that you’re overestimating your credentials; or\nThe person reviewing your resume doesn’t even think to check how many pages there are and only sees the first one anyway\n\nIn general, if you want to include more information about yourself that would spill your resume past the first page, you should use LinkedIn as your “full” resume and continue to keep this document to just a one-page review of the most relevant things about yourself.\nAlong with this, there are two sections that people expect to see on resumes:\n\nEducation (or equivalent) section (see the Education section for more details)\nExperience section (see the Experience section for more details)\n\nBasics of Typst\nPreviously, this template was created in LaTeX, another PDF typesetting language. To celebrate its 40th(!) birthday, we’re killing it in favor of Typst!\nTypst is a gentler PDF typesetting language that supports putting far more of the “noise” of your formatting into a separate file. That way, the only thing you really have to worry about is putting your content into this file.\nTo learn more about Typst, you can find the documentation here: typst.app/docs\nHeader &amp; Contact Information\nThis is where you should put your name, your contact information, and your general location!\n#import &quot;util/resume.template.typ&quot;: *\n#show: resume.with(\n  author: &quot;Dr. Emmit \\&quot;Doc\\&quot; Brown&quot;,\n  location: &quot;Hill Valley, CA&quot;,\n  contacts: (\n    [#link(&quot;mailto:sample_resume@chaoticgood.computer&quot;)[Email]],\n    [#link(&quot;chaoticgood.computer&quot;)[Website]],\n    [#link(&quot;github.com/spelkington&quot;)[GitHub]],\n    [#link(&quot;linkedin.com/in/spelkington&quot;)[LinkedIn]],\n  )\n)\n\nOpinion: Specifying Your Location\nSometimes, people put their full mailing address on their resume. I personally believe that you should leave your location to ONLY the general metropolitan area you’re in. This is for a few reasons:\n\nFull mailing addresses are noisy, and wherever possible you should try to eliminate noise from your resume. Recruiters only really need to know your general location, so it’s better to just keep it short and simple.\nAs a general safety rule-of-thumb, you should try to not publicly post the address of the place you sleep on the internet. ¯\\(ツ)/¯\n\nOpinion: Including Your Phone Number\nPersonally, I would HIGHLY advise you leave your personal phone number off of your resume. Odds are, you’ll be sending this resume to one of two types of places:\n\nPublic areas, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, a website you own, etc.\nPrivate areas, such as a potential employer’s application portal or a private message\n\nGiven that this may be in public areas, posting your phone number on the resume itself may pose the risk of opening you up to unsolicited calls &amp; harassment. As somebody who has had their number leaked and been harassed with it since then, that’s a hard genie to put back into the bottle - I strongly advise against taking that risk.\nHowever, when you’re privately sending your resume, you’re likely to be putting your phone number into a separate application field anyway, or even sending your resume over a private channel directly. In that case, a private recipient will already have your contact information, including your phone number. This means that having your phone number here has a lot of risk and virtually no added reward.\nUnless you have a good, explicit reason for doing so, don’t put your phone number on your resume.\nOpinion: Use Hyperlinks!\nIn the year of our lord 20XX, it is vastly more likely that somebody reviewing your resume is using a digital, internet-connected device. This may vary industry-to-industry, but the chances of a person printing your resume to review it become lower and lower each year.\nWhen somebody is viewing your resume digitally, you have the massive advantage of being able to include hyperlinks to other areas of the internet on your resume! This effectively turns the document into a landing page for other valuable resources:\n\nYour LinkedIn, email, GitHub, website, etc.\nThe sites of companies that you’ve worked for to provide additional context about where you worked\nElaborate or “follow up” projects you’ve done and skills you’ve had with real-world proof that you’ve posted on the internet\n\nOn the other hand, there is a risk that somebody out there is still printing stacks of resumes to review. Additionally, you may have to print off your resume from time to time - something that can come of often if you’re, for example, a student attending your university’s job fairs. In that case, you may need to tune your hyperlinks to still be usable on printed paper.\n\nIF YOU’RE WORRIED YOUR RESUME WILL BE PRINTED, MODIFY THE TEXT OF THE HYPERLINK TO BE THE SAME AS THE LINK ITSELF.\n\nEducation\nThis is where formal education goes! While this is usually university education, it doesn’t have to be. You can also include:\n\nCertification Programs\nBoot Camps\nAssociates/college degrees\n\n= Education\n#edu(\n  institution: &quot;University of California, Berkeley&quot;,\n  date: &quot;Aug 1953&quot;,\n  location: &quot;Berkeley, CA&quot;,\n  degrees: (\n    (&quot;Ph.D.&quot;, &quot;Theoretical Physics&quot;),\n  ),\n)\n \n#edu(\n  institution: &quot;University of Colombia&quot;,\n  date: &quot;Aug 1948&quot;,\n  gpa: &quot;3.9 of 4.0, Summa Cum Laude&quot;,\n  degrees: (\n    (&quot;Bachelor&#039;s of Science&quot;, &quot;Nuclear Engineering&quot;),\n    (&quot;Minors&quot;, &quot;Automobile Design, Arabic&quot;),\n    (&quot;Focus&quot;, &quot;Childcare, Education&quot;)\n  ),\n)\n\nIf what you put here is not “education” in the normal sense and fits more with the subjects above, you may want to consider renaming it. However, the general advice I’ve received from technical recruiters, technical interviewers, and fellow professionals over the years is that an Education section containing university degrees should usually stay at the top of your resume.\nTIP FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: Companies will use this information to background check to confirm you have the degree you claim to have. Because this is one of the background check entries that HAS to check out, DO NOT MODIFY THE TYPE, NAME, OR GRADUATION DATE OF YOUR DEGREES, MINORS, OR EMPHASES.\nBelieve me — as somebody who has a degree in “Quantitative Analysis of Markets and Organizations,” I sure do wish I could abbreviate that down to “Quantitative Economics” for the sake of space and not having to explain what the hell that means. However — because that is the God-given name of my degree, that HAS to stay EXACTLY consistent in order to comply properly with background checks.\nHowever, as a sneaky way around that requirement, you can add additional information here in an unofficial way. For example, “Focus” is not typically a University-registered piece of information, and something you have a bit of wiggle room on. For example, if you studied Computer Science and your coursework mainly focused on front-end development, but you didn’t get a formal emphasis in “Frontend Development”, you could do:\ndegrees: (\n  (&quot;Bachelor&#039;s of Science&quot;, &quot;Computer Science&quot;),\n  (&quot;Focus&quot;, &quot;Frontend Development&quot;)\n)\nDegree paths on the university level can vary from very broad to very specific - especially on a graduate level. This additional degree entree field trick is a good way to sneak additional context into your education section in a way that won’t hit snags during a background check.\nOpinion: Including Your GPA\nGPA is a testy subject. Some of us have great GPAs, some of us have alright GPAs, and some of us had an off year (or two, if you were in college during COVID) and if you ask us about it, we’ll avoid the subject entirely. Additionally, some companies require a GPA, others would prefer you have it, and some (the cool ones) don’t give a hoot what your GPA is. Here is the general rule-of-thumb for when to (or to not) include your GPA:\n\nDEFINITELY include your GPA IF:\n\nit is above a ~3.5/4.0 (which is usually the threshold of Deans List or your university’s equivalent); OR\nyou know for a fact that the company you’re applying for requires it.\n\n\nPOSSIBLY include your GPA IF:\n\nyour GPA is between a 3.0 and 3.5, and you feel it would help your applications.\n\n\nPROBABLY don’t include your GPA IF: It’s below a 3.0.\n\nIf you do want to include your GPA, the #edu section will automatically format it for you if you add a gpa value to your entry.\nYou can also use the gpa: field to elaborate on extra tags like “Dean’s List”, “Honors”, “(Summa) Cum Laude”, etc.\nOpinion: Including a Graduation Date\nIf you’re currently in an education program, you should put the estimated month and year you believe you’ll be finishing your program. You have two ways you can do this:\n\nSet the date field to some variant of “Estimated MONTH 20XX”\nJust put the month and year in the future that you intend to graduate.\n\nPrior to graduating, I opted to go with option 2 and never ran into issues. In general, people and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are smart enough to intuit that a graduation date in the future means that you’re still a student.\nSkills\nThe Skills section is where you can give an overarching view of what you’re good at and what you know! This section is broken out into categories. In general, here are some breakouts that I’ve used in the past:\n\nExpertise/Key Skills: Subjects, fields, and “soft” skills that you’re knowledgeable in. KEEP THIS ONE.\nSoftware: specific pieces of software relevant to your industry that you’re comfortable using\nLanguages: Usually this means “programming languages,” but I’ve seen the polyglots among us use a Languages section for written/spoken languages as well\nCertifications: If you feel like certifications you have don’t fit into your Education section well, or you don’t want to spend as much vertical space listing them, you can place them here instead\n\nOpinion: What Should You Put Here?\nSo, one thing you have to understand is that human reviewers are not the only audience for your resume. When you’re applying to for jobs and not personally handing off your resume to another human being, you should assume that your resume is going to be reviewed by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) before it ever even sees human eyes.\nATS are bots used to pre-review resumes. In general, these bots are doing a comparison analysis of your resume against the description of the job you’re applying for. One of the primary things it does is a keyword analysis, where it is more-or-less asking the question:\n\nHow many keywords in this resume match keywords in the job description?\n\nTHIS SECTION IS THE PLACE TO MATCH THOSE KEYWORDS.\nThis section will be the part of your resume that changes the most. Ideally, you’ll be fine-tuning this section for each application you do to best fit your resume against the description of the job you’re applying for.\nThis is where “commenting out” comes in handy. In Typst, you can add // (or Ctrl+/, if you’re using the Typst editor) before any text to remove the text from your final resume WITHOUT removing it from this file. This makes it very easy to make new versions of your resume without actually permanently deleting it.\nIn general, the workflow I advise for creating this section is an “everything in the kitchen sink” approach:\n\nPut in ALL of your skills and interests, all the languages you comfortably know, all the software you know how to use, etc., into each category.\nOrder each section by how comfortable or skilled you are with what you’ve listed. For example, if you put “Python” and “JavaScript” into the Languages section and are more comfortable with Python, put that first in the list.\nComment out the entire list.\nTake the job description of a job you’d like to apply for and put it into a keyword analysis service like JobScan (jobscan.io) or ChatGPT to get all the job’s keywords out of the description.\nUncomment (remove the //) of things in each section that match the job description until the category is a line long OR you hit the end of your list\n(Optional) If you noticed keywords in the job description that you would be comfortable adding, add them to the list.\n\nOpinion: Including Programming Languages\nEngineers get real weird about which programming languages you include on your resume. In general, here is the unspoken, unwritten policy around programming languages on your resume:\n\nIf a technical interviewer sees a programming language on your resume, they will assume it’s fair game for a technical interview.\n\nNow - how does this mesh with the advice above to add things in the job description to your resume? Here’s the rule of thumb for whether or not to include a language on your resume:\nYou should include a programming language IF:\n\nYou are already comfortable enough with that language to do a technical interview using that language; OR\nYou are reasonably acquainted with a language AND feel that you can learn enough — fast enough — to do a technical interview in that programming language in 2 or less full-time, dedicated days of brushing up on that language\n\nOption 2 is an ethically dicey and professionally risky move to make, but not totally unrealistic. I’d advise that the line you should draw is:\n\nIf I’ll need to frequently look up basic syntax in that language by the time I apply for this job, I probably shouldn’t include it.\n\nOpinion: Including Software\nSoftware will be incredibly industry- and job-specific. It would be impossible to give a comprehensive list of things you should include across all industries - however, I can give you some advice on what not to include:\n\nDo NOT include text editors. If you’re in the software industry, this includes your IDE!\nDo NOT include operating systems UNLESS:\n\nIt is a niche and specific operating system (e.g., Red Hat Linux); AND/OR\nIt is because you’ve done OS-level development on it, in which case you should be VERY specific (e.g., Linux Kernel Dev, Windows PowerShell, etc.); OR\nIt is specifically mentioned in the requirements for the job.\n\n\nDo NOT include professional chat apps like Slack, Teams, Discord, etc. UNLESS:\n\nYou have done some kind of advanced development on it, in which case you should be VERY specific (e.g., Slack Bots)\nFor whatever reason, the job description explicitly mentions it. Keep in mind: if the job description says anything along the lines of “Familiar with [APP]”, you should giggle to yourself because that’s an objectively weird thing to list in your job description.\n\n\nAND PLEASE\n\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD\n\nDO NOT\n\nINCLUDE\n\nMICROSOFT WORD OR OFFICE 365\n\nBECAUSE IF YOU INCLUDE THOSE\n\nEVERYONE WHO READS YOUR RESUME\n\nWILL MAKE FUN OF YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK\n\nOR POSSIBLY EVEN TO YOUR FACE\n\nBECAUSE IT IS\n\nTHE MODERN EQUIVALENT\n\nOF LISTING “TYPING” AS A SKILL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a buddy, contact, or even friend-of-a-friend working in the industry you’re applying for, it’d be in your best interest to ask them for a once-over to make sure nothing you put here feels silly.\nOpinion: Stating Proficiency in a Language\nFor both natural languages and programming languages, I have sometimes seen people list their proficiency next to the languages: e.g.\n\nLanguages: C# (advanced), Python (proficient), …\n\nor\n\nLanguages: English (fluent), Spanish (fluent), Arabic (conversational)…\n\nI would highly recommend this for natural languages. I would somewhat, possibly — maybe — recommend it for programming languages. If you do it for one language, though, you should really do it for all languages. Only doing it for one or two languages — but none of the others — may seem to imply you don’t know the other languages as well and are listing it as a form of cheap talk.\nIf you want to emphasize particular skill with a programming language, you can also:\n\nList it towards the start of the list; and\nInline-bold it to emphasize expertise.\n\nThis strategy allows the design to convey the idea of proficiency through emphasis, and doesn’t require you to waste valuable space to declare proficiency for all the languages you list.\nOpinion: Hyperlink Your Skills\nI personally believe that this area is a good candidate for hyperlinks. For example, I tend to hyperlink my strongest areas/software/languages in particular to examples of when I’ve worked with or done those things in the wild. This is a good reason you should strive to make projects of yours open source with good READMEs, or post your accomplishments somewhere (a website, blog, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc.).\nOpinion: Dedicating an Entire Section to Skills\nWhen you’re trying to keep your resume down to one page, vertical space is a valuable resource. In that regard, section headers are pretty expensive, taking up about ~3 bullet points for each one you use. While they’re important for breaking up your resume into sections for comprehensibility reasons, too many can become a waste of vertical space that could otherwise be used in better ways.\nI included a Skills header in this template because people explicitly break this section out often enough that I wanted to make it plug-and-play for those transferring old resumes over. However, I’d highly recommend rolling your Skills section into your Education section by deleting (or commenting out) the Skills line below.\nThe exception to this rule is that you should have a dedicated skills section if you’re largely self-taught and feel that an Education section may not be a good fit.\nWork Experience\nThis is where you make your resume shine! By and large, the advice here applies to all other sections of your resume, as the pattern through the rest of the resume uses the same “Experience” (#exp) method for formatting.\n= Experience\n#exp(\n  role: &quot;Theoretical Physics Consultant&quot;,\n  project: &quot;Doc Brown&#039;s Garage&quot;,\n  date: &quot;June 1953 - Oct 2015&quot;,\n  location: &quot;Hill Valley, CA&quot;,\n  summary: &quot;Specializing in development of time travel devices and student tutoring&quot;,\n  details: [\n    - Lead development of time travel devices, resulting in the ability to travel back and forth through time\n    - Managed and executed a budget of \\$14 million dollars gained from an unexplained family fortune\n    - Oversaw QA testing for time travel devices, minimizing risk of maternal time-travel related incidents\n  ]\n)\n \n#exp(\n  role: &quot;Teaching Assistant&quot;,\n  project: &quot;University of Colombia, Wernher von Braun Lab&quot;,\n  date: &quot;Oct 1949 - June 1953&quot;,\n  summary: &quot;Integrating German scientists&#039; curriculi for undergraduate audiences&quot;,\n  details: [\n    - Assisted in designing physics course structure and assignments in English, Spanish and German\n    - Designed confidential rocket designs used in NASA Space Race initiatives and the Apollo Program\n    - Developed and executed university DEI initiatives and onboarding programs for transfer professors\n  ]\n)\n\nEach experience entry has the following attributes you can add:\n\nJob Title (role:)\nEmployer/Project Title (project:)\nDate (date:)\n\n\nThis should be a MONTH 20XX - MONTH 20XX entry, using “Present” or “Current” to denote the position you currently work at.\nFor these dates — and, in general, all dates on your resume - I’d recommend abbreviating months (e.g., January -&gt; Jan, December -&gt; Dec, etc.) to conserve space.\n\n\nLocation (location:) (OPTIONAL)\n\n\nIn the era of remote work, the location of a job has lost quite a bit of signal. IN MY OPINION, the location you state in your header would provide an interviewer or recruiter with enough information about your location, causing additional role locations to fall a bit into the same “noise” category we talked about above. However, some reasons you may want to include it are:\n\nYou’re applying for a job that you know will be doing a more thorough background check, such as a government, military-adjacent, or high-security position\nYou want to put “Remote” for some of your positions to make it incredibly clear that you are a remote worker with no interest in relocating to an office.\nYou’re using cool places you’ve worked to flavor your resume and start conversations in your interviews (e.g., “Oh, wow, you’ve been to France/worked in New York/yodeled in Singapore/etc. etc.? Tell me more about that!”)\n\n\n\n\nRole/employer/project summary (summary:) (OPTIONAL)\n\n\nI’ve seen this on enough resumes, and have warmed up to it over time. This can be used to give a brief(!!!) description of the company you worked at, projects you focused on, or role you worked in.\nThis can be especially helpful at both larger companies to specify what specific vertical you worked in, or at smaller companies to give on-page context to who they are and what they do.\nIn some circumstances, it can substitute as a bullet point and give you more room in your bullet points to drill down into specifics without having to give overarching context.\n\n\nDetails — VERY IDEALLY BULLET POINTS — describing the entry (details:)\n\nOpinion: Creating New Entries\nFor the details section of your experience entries, I would HIGHLY recommend keeping it to exclusively bullet points. Typically, the range of bullet points you should have for an experience entry is:\n\nThree bullet points by default; with\n(Maybe) Four bullet points for your current (or particularly cool or relevant) positions and projects; and\n(Possibly) Two bullet points for old or “thinner” projects or experiences (e.g. seasonal employments, short-term projects, old experience, etc.)\n\nThat’s a lot of bullet points, which means that the bulk of your resume will be SHORT, CONCISE SNIPPETS describing aspects of your experiences.\nOpinion: Creating Well-Structured Bullet Points\n\nIF YOU TAKE NOTHING ELSE AWAY FROM THIS TEMPLATE, IT SHOULD BE THIS.\n\nBullet points are going to be making up the bulk of your resume, so it’s important to make sure that they’re concise, to-the-point, and convey exactly why you’re a good fit for the job you’re applying for. This structure is informed by a lot of reviews with technical recruiters, professionals/engineers, and hiring managers at companies of many different sizes. You should do your best to make sure that every bullet point has these three components - known as an XYZ structure:\n\nX: What you did\nY: How you did it\nZ: The (measurable) result\n\nWhile there are a lot of ways to include these three components in your bullet points, the general “out-of-the-box” structure is below:\n\n[VERB] a [NOUN] using [METHOD] for [REASON], resulting in [RESULT]\n\nIf that makes zero sense, don’t worry — here’s an example:\n\nOptimized data pipelines written in Spark/AWS for financial analysis, resulting in &gt;$1M annual compute cost reductions\n\nThat one matches almost one-to-one with the structure above and has all three components:\n\nX: What you did (Optimized data pipelines)\nY: How you did it (Used knowledge of Spark and AWS)\nZ: The (measurable) result (Saved lots of money on compute costs)\n\nFor the sake of brevity, we’ll do just the one example up here. However, I’ll post samples of other bullet points from other resumes that do a good job of including these three components.\nIf you’re trying to hammer out your first few bullet points in that structure and are thinking to yourself, “Wow, this is hard!” — don’t worry! It takes awhile (and a lot of trial-and-error) to get the hang of, but will become a lot easier as you write more.\nAdditionally, this is a really good reason to have somebody else review your bullet points (and your resume in general) — to this day, I still ask people to review my resume to make sure my bullet points get the point across well, and convey the three points from that structure concisely.\nOpinion: Including Measurable Results\nIn general, if you have measurable results of your actions that you can include in bullet points, you should. It demonstrates to others the effectiveness of the actions you took in terms of metrics that people understand how to interpret. However, it is by far the hardest part of a bullet point to include, and you may not be able to include a measurable result for a couple different reasons:\n\nYou simply don’t have a measurable result associated with the bullet point\nYou may be constrained by an NDA or equivalent restriction on publicly providing hard numbers, metrics, or details\n\nIf you don’t have a measurable result to include, don’t worry — the X (what) and Y (how) components are still enough to make a good bullet point. However, if you’re in a position to gather those metrics (for example, if you’re still at your current company and have the ability to measure or find that data), I’d advise taking the time to go do that.\nThis is also a matter of opinion! Sometimes — especially if you work at a company that doesn’t religiously measure Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) — the exactness of the metrics you have access to will vary wildly. If you’re in a scientific field, you may have very precise measurements down to a lot of significant figures. On the other hand, in industry, maybe your measurements are ballpark estimates, like the type you’d find in an executive summary.\nIn general, I’d limit the number of “significant figures” of your metrics to 2 digits. 2 digits is enough to get a whole-number percent (e.g. 25%) or a good monetary estimate (e.g. 120,000 or 120k).\nAdditionally, the exactness of a measurable result you include should be something you can justify to both yourself and others.\nPhilosophically, I’d consider the ability to justify a statement to be the difference between “an estimate” and “bullshit.”\nFOR EXAMPLE: I worked in a job where, as an employee, I proposed a new system we use now for replicating AWS environments and spinning up new infrastructure (TL;DR copy and pasting big pieces of technology automagically). Before we had that system, engineers would just do the whole thing by hand.\nBefore I worked there, there was an occasion where the team had to reconstruct an entirely sandboxed copy of an application, by hand, for a new client. If memory serves, this took a few engineers roughly 4 months. Now, with the new system, we can do the same task in about 3 hours.\nOn paper, the actual optimization would be:\n\n3 engineers * 40 hours * 12 weeks = 1440 hours\n1440 hours previously - 3 hours now,\n1437 saved / 1440 hours originally =\na 99.7% time optimization.\n\nHOWEVER — I hadn’t done that math until literally just now, as I was typing it. When I wrote the bullet point for that entry on my own resume, I vaguely went “3 hours now versus 3 months before? That’s probably more than 90% ¯\\(ツ)/¯”\nAs of writing, that bullet point on my entry is:\n\nCreate Terraform/AWS deployment systems, reducing new AWS application spin-up times by &gt;90%\n\nIs it precise? Absolutely not. Can I justify it? Probably, if I had to. So that’s the metric that I used.\n(Although I probably will make it more specific now that I’ve done the math.)\nWhen it comes to results that you know exist beyond a shadow of a doubt, but don’t have incredibly hard data on, using a ~ in front of the number is your best friend.\n(Of all the characters available on the standard keyboard, ~ is certainly the one that most represents the mathematical equivalent of “vibes.”)\nFor example, if you improve, refine, or automate a tedious process at work and the consensus among the people you’ve helped is “This is about twice as fast now!”, you shouldn’t hesitate to throw down a “~50% improvement” as a measurable result.\nIf you’re looking for measurable results at your current position, you have the incredible advantage of still being at your current position. KPIs - the things you can measure to gauge the success of your work - are both a difficult thing to collect and a valuable thing to have, as they can help you get new job or build a case for increased compensation at your current job now. If you can, take time at your current job to build structures that allow you to accurately measure results of your actions.\nOpinion: Keep Your Bullets Concise!\nWhen you’re writing bullet points, you should try to keep them to a whole-integer number of lines used. Here’s a less-weirdly-phrased example to illustrate what I mean:\n- Lead development of time travel devices, resulting in the &lt;LINE BREAK&gt; \n  ability to travel back and forth through time ........................\nIn that case, see how there’s quite a bit of space remaining on the second line? We usually refer to this as a “hanging bullet point”. Hanging bullet points are an issue for a few reasons:\n\nVertical space on your resume is a valuable resource, especially if you’re doing a RESUME resume (and not a CV) where you should limit yourself to one page. In this case, you’re sacrificing an extra line for only half as much information, when it may be better spent creating a separate bullet point.\nThe reader has to now read into a second line. When somebody is quickly reviewing your resume, they may not bother reading that far into a single bullet point.\nIn a very wishy-washy “the-vibes-are-off” kind of way, it causes the whitespace of your resume to look uneven and your resume to look slightly incomplete, especially if the second line is only one or two words.\n\nIn general, you should really aim to avoid these instances altogether. A few solutions you have (in the order I’d recommend them) are:\n\nTrim the bullet point to fit onto a single line.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend most of the time, as it also has the added benefit of forcing you to be more concise in your wording to get the point across\n\n\nSplit the bullet point into two distinct bullet points.\n\n\nIn this case, you may be able to massage things around in a way that gives you two concise points rather than one inconcise one\n\n\nAdd more context to the bullet point (a method you used or another measurable result) to strengthen the point in the space that you have\n\n\nI don’t recommend this. While I’ve seen it done well (in cases where there was no logical way to split the bullet point AND the extra space was used to add really good metrics), I’d wager that 99% of the time people use two lines for a bullet point, it’s because they’re rambling and should’ve done Option 1 or Option 2 instead.\n\nOpinion: Mention Your Skills (and make them bold!)\nOften, in constructing your bullet points, the Y component (how you did it) will involve a specific technology, process, skill, or programming language. In that case, I highly advise that you inline bold (surround the text with asterisks, e.g. *Python*, *Illustrator*, etc).\nThe reason I recommend this is because of the “talk is cheap” principal. In the Skills section of a resume, it is very, very easy for people to overestimate their skill in things. I can vividly recall the time I put SQL in my Skills section, only to absolutely eat shit on a SQL technical interview I got as a result.\n(I did not get the job.)\nInterviewers understand that this section is very easy to overpack, which is why I said above that the section is largely for the benefit of strengthening your ability to get past ATS by including tokens from the job description. However, your projects and experience - especially ones that you can hyperlink to - are far less likely to be total bullshit, and so mentions of specific technologies, languages, and skills here hold far more signal potential for reviewers.\nBy inline-bolding specific mentions of technology, software, and languages you use, you’re both encouraged to mention them more often (which strengthens your match score with ATS) and also gives interviewers a very quick second confirmation that you can back up the skills you’ve put in your Skills section.\nI have also seen people inline bold the measurable results they include in their bullet points. I’m personally pretty neutral on this practice, as it has the potential to highlight your more impressive achievements, but also potentially adds noise to your resume. Caveat lector - reader beware!\nOpinion: “But I don’t want to use bullet points!”\nYou really should. Especially at large companies, your resume will largely be viewed at a glance and the conciseness of well-structured bullet points reflects that reality.\nThe exception is those of you making a CV, which means you probably (you should) have a PhD or many, many years of professional experience and massive accomplishments to boot. If that’s the case, this template is still able to accommodate much of what you need. In your case, though, the expectation is likely that you describe things like publications, papers, presentations, etc. with concise abstracts (abstract-of-your-abstract) rather than bullet points.\nIf that does apply to you (once again, if you’re not sure it does then it probably doesn’t), the details: field of the #exp format does allow you to do non-bulleted descriptions while still taking advantage of the built-in formatting for everything else.\nOpinion: Ordering Your Experience\nAs you get further into your working life, old experiences may start to feel “stale”, either because they were many years ago or because they don’t fit as well with your current career aspirations. If you start running out of vertical space to keep your resume under one page and feel you want to trim down your Experience section, my general guidelines would be:\n\nAlways order your experiences chronologically.\n\nThere is a bit of wiggle room with jobs that you hold (or have held) concurrently. In those cases, I’d recommend breaking ties for which experience should go first by which one feels more relevant to the job you’re currently applying for.\n\n\nIf you don’t have a very long history of work (for example, you’re still very new to working professionally), trim bullet points that aren’t relevant to your current applications off of some entries. Prioritize trimming bullets from older experiences first!\nIf you’re trimming an experience to just one bullet point, you should remove it altogether.\n\nWHEN YOU’RE TRIMMING THINGS OFF ANYWHERE OFF OF YOUR RESUME, YOU SHOULD PREFER TO COMMENT THEM OUT RATHER THAN DELETE THEM ENTIRELY.\nFrom the bajillion requisites of what constitutes a good bullet point, you should assume that they’re a real pain in the ass to get right. Once you’ve made good bullet points for an entry, lean towards commenting that entry (or individual bullet points) out rather than deleting them entirely.\nIt could be the case later that an entry you’ve trimmed previously would be a good fit with your current applications. In that case, rather than have to re-make the entry from scratch, you can simply uncomment the relevant information and restore it to your resume as-is.\nOpinion: Listing Gap Periods\nWhen trimming experience, one thing you want to avoid is gaps on your resume. The entries in your experience section should ideally represent one continuous block of time, with potentially some occasional one-month gaps between entries.\nWhile I (as a reviewer) tend to ignore gaps because there’s a billion totally valid reasons those can happen (Maybe they were a full-time student, or taking care of a loved one, or got laid off and worked in an unrelated field to make ends meet, or took care of a child or parent, or they stumbled on a bag of money and fucked off to bike Europe for a year, etc.). However, sometimes significant resume gaps freak people out.\nIf you’re in the process of removing non-relevant experience from your resume and find yourself with a noticeable gap (&gt;4 months), I’d recommend adding a summarized-but-not-detailed entry for the gap period.\nFor example:\n#exp(\n  role: &quot;Caretaker&quot;,\n  project: &quot;Gap Period&quot;,\n  date: &quot;April 2020 - March 2021&quot;,\n  summary: &quot;Provided full-time support to vulnerable family members during COVID-19&quot;,\n  details: []\n)\nThis entry is concise, explains the gap period, and conserves vertical space on your resume.\nHonestly? If anybody has a problem with a well-explained gap period, they have no business leading or hiring people.\nOpinion: Hyperlinking in your Experience\nAs usual, I’d recommend including some hyperlinks in these sections under the assumption that a reviewer will be seeing this on a digital device and could hypothetically click on the links for additional context.\nIn general, the hyperlinks I tend to include are:\n\nIn the headers, with links to the company’s website or product that you worked on; and\nSparingly in the bullet points, with links to publicized achievements or products you helped work on and mention explicitly in a bullet point.\nIn some cases, links to additional resources mentioned in your bullet points\n\nI see this used most often in fields related to “real science” (e.g. chemistry, biology, mechanical engineering) or in cases where industries are regulated (education, manufacturing, safety, environmental consulting) where it can be worth relating to specific documentation for procedures, legal compliance documentation, public-use datasets, or firm-level certification processes\n\n\n\nAdditional Sections\nIn general, the only hard-advised sections of a resume that I’ve seen consistently recommended are the Education (or equivalent) and Experience sections. The other sections are largely up to you. However, here are some recommendations based on other sections I’ve seen people use to great effect, or use on my own resume:\n\nProjects, especially if you’re in the tech industry where personal projects are encouraged or expected\nVolunteering\nCharity\nLeadership\nAwards (which, depending on your preferences, could reasonably use a different entry format)\n\n= Projects\n \n#exp(\n  role: link(&quot;www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/&quot;)[The Delorean],\n  project: &quot;Doc Brown&#039;s Garage&quot;,\n  date: &quot;May 1954 - June 1985&quot;,\n  summary: &quot;A stylish and fully-featured vehicle capable of time travel - with mixed results&quot;,\n  details: [\n    - Designed vehicle modifications allowing for time travel and *37% increased cup holder capacity*\n    - Ethically sourced materials from various international Colombian and Libyan providers\n    - Coordinated business relationships with potential clients and interested parties\n  ]\n)\n \n#exp(\n  role: &quot;Doc Brown&#039;s Mega Cup-o-Matic&quot;,\n  project: &quot;Doc Brown&#039;s Garage&quot;,\n  date: &quot;October 1949 - June 1953&quot;,\n  details: [\n    - Filed a patent for a new type of car cupholder, for storing cups of nuclear material up to 1L\n    - Developed nuclear hazard procedures for high school students interested in time and nuclear physics\n  ]\n)\n \n= Volunteering\n#exp(\n  role: &quot;Student Advisor&quot;,\n  project: &quot;Doc&#039;s Kidz After-School Child Care Service&quot;,\n  date: &quot;May 1954 - June 1985&quot;,\n  summary: &quot;Giving random highschoolers hands-on experience in live nuclear engineering&quot;,\n  details: [\n    - Created community initiative to teach local student(s) about the wonders of nuclear physics\n    - Provided interesting time travel research opportunities for students to add to their college applications\n  ]\n)\n\nA flavor of section that I see a lot - and would NOT recommend - is something along the lines of “Hobbies” or “Interests”. This is occasionally recommended to give “flavor” to your resume or “humanize” you in some way.\n(I understand that putting quotes around “flavor” and “humanize” make me sound like a boring robot of a person, but bear with me, here.)\n\nIf you’re tempted to make (or are transferring over from an old resume that has) a Hobbies (or Hobbies-adjacent) section, I would advise you structure your hobbies as Projects and use a Projects section instead.\n\nMany hobbies (sports, programming, gaming, knitting(?), graphic design/drawing, writing, woodworking, baking, etc) can be safely structured in the same way Projects would be, and allow you to highlight interesting things about yourself in a way that follows the same design pattern as the rest of your experiences.\nOpinion: Making Additional Sections Work\nIf you’re making a resume for the first time or are early in your career, you may feel yourself straining to fill vertical space. If that’s the case - or if you’re just looking to liven up your resume a bit - I’d recommend doing a “throw it all in the kitchen sink” approach.\nWith this approach, create new entries for anything that you could possibly conceive of as being interesting, taught you skills, or could be an even half-viable answer to somebody asking you “So, what have you done with your life?” A lot of things that don’t feel like they’d fit into the hand-shakey, back-pat-y world of business, industry, and academia can be spun into things that feel like they belong on a resume.\nSome examples of experiences people have put that have been used to great effect, and some general examples of how I’ve seen them stated, are:\n\nSports Leagues/Fitness (intramural, professional, etc)\n\nConstructing routines\nDesigning training plans\nCooperation/collaboration\n\n\nGaming (competitively, recreationally, collaboratively (e.g. D&amp;D))\n\nCompetitively (cooperation/team-building/recruiting)\nSpeedrunning (attention to detail, QA, methodology)\nCreating games as a learning experience\nPlaying/leading D&amp;D as a design experience (homebrewed content, especially), coordinating people, etc.\n\n\nWoodworking/Construction\nPlanning projects\nCreating designs\nSolving problems\nMaking brownies\n\nThis isn’t even a bit. The guy’s name is Dylan, and his brownies kicked so much ass that they got these-brownies-kicked-ass-type awards. He had it on his CV and got into MIT — probably not solely off the brownies, but I’d take an even-money bet that it helped.\n\n\n\nIn general, whatever you throw in the kitchen sink, the key is describing it with the same structure and detail as your experience, trying to fit it into the XYZ bullet structure as well as possible. Even if your experience is really weird, the way you describe it can be the difference between “Why did they even bother mentioning that?” and “Oh, that is pretty impressive!”\nI would also recommend having the same approach with these entries as you’d take for your Skills section, where you pretty judicially add and remove (comment out!) things from this section for the jobs you’re applying for, based on what might fight best with the general “vibe” of the applications you’re doing. While your job experience is a pretty binary “Describe the last X jobs you’ve had over the last Y years”, this section is very fluid by comparison.\nIn this section especially, I’d recommend following the guidance for hyperlinking mentioned in the Experience section above.","date":"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z"},"content/notes/utah-office-consult":{"slug":"content/notes/utah-office-consult","filePath":"content/notes/utah-office-consult.md","title":"Utah Office Consult","links":[],"tags":["writing/annotations","engineering/languages/python","economics/strategy","engineering/data","projects/college"],"content":"","date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Welcome!","links":["tags/horticulture/","tags/projects/","tags/economics/","tags/engineering/","tags/writing/tutorials/"],"tags":["engineering","economics","horticulture"],"content":"This site is a dedicated digital garden of articles, tutorials, and notes related to my personal life and work, as well as work I do through Chaotic Good Computing, a separate business I run for consulting and OSS projects around economics, engineering, and tutorials.","date":"2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"},"resume":{"slug":"resume","filePath":"resume.mdx","title":"Résumé","links":["assets/Elkington_Resume.pdf"],"tags":["projects/dayjob","engineering","economics"],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  NOTE\n                  \n                \n\nTest!\n\n\nSpencer Elkington - ResumeDownloadLoading PDF viewer...Open PDF in new tab","date":"2026-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"},"tags/economics/finance/index":{"slug":"tags/economics/finance/index","filePath":"tags/economics/finance/index.md","title":"#economics/finance","links":["tags/engineering/data/","content/articles/structured-streaming"],"tags":[],"content":"I spent the start of my career in data engineering at fintech companies.
