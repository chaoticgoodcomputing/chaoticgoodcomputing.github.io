## Rationale

About a year and a half ago, I started off the [[tags/horticulture/seasons/rhythm/index|Season of Rhythm]]. At that point, it was early 2024 and a few things had thrown me for a loop:

- I (finally!) finished [[tags/projects/college/index|my undergraduate degree at the University of Utah]] after far too long. It was hardly a photo finish — I had already been working full-time in the software industry for ~two years to pay for what was, effectively, a bunch of unrelated gen-ed credit I'd put off
- I had switched jobs, going from a hybrid role to a fully remote one
