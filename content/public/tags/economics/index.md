Economics is where I spent my [[content/notes/qamo|actual undergraduate career]]. While I work professionally as a [[tags/engineering/index|general software engineer]], the start of my career was in [[tags/economics/finance/index|finance/fintech]].

When I was studying economics, most of my academic focus was in [[tags/economics/markets/index|market design]] and non-monetary systems like:

- Efficient task delegation, which — very helpfully — carries over to [[content/articles/structured-streaming|efficiencies in distributed computing]] and project management;
- [[content/notes/stability-of-marriage|Matchmaking algorithms]]; and
- Incentive structures in markets where monetary compensation is a secondary concern, such as the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem.
