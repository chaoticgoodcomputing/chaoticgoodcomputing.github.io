A [[tags/engineering/data/index|data engineering project]] that attempts to use a Kedro-style API surface to create data pipelines in [[tags/engineering/languages/csharp/index|.NET]] that will catch errors at compile time, instead of at runtime.

The first production project using Flowthru is the analysis portions of [[tags/projects/magic-atlas/index|MagicAtlas]]
