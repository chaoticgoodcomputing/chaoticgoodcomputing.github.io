In the era of [[ai-policy|AI consuming everything publicly available on the Internet]], I made a call during my [[tags/horticulture/seasons/systems/index|Season of Systems]] to take some of the more personal notes — primarily the periodic notes, like dailies and weeklies — private. I keep the metadata, like tags and links, available. However, most of them are stashed away separate from this site and repository.

If you do see a private note that catches your eye, and you'd like to know more about it, you're absolutely welcome to [[contact|reach out]]. If it's not terribly sensitive, I'd be happy to chat about it!
