As part of my [[public/tags/horticulture/index|daily gardening]], I write brief notes about tasks to get done at my day job. The vast majority of these notes will be private, except when taking notes on other publicly-available materials that I am recommended, or assigned to annotate, at work.

If you do have questions about my daily work, [[resume|my resume]] has publicly-available information about broad strokes responsibilities. You're also welcome to [[contact|contact me]] — if it's something I'm clear to talk about, I'm happy to chat!
