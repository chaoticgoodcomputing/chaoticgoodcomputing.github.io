In 2022, I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Quantitative Analysis of Markets and Organizations (it's just [[tags/economics/index|economics]] with a fancy name) and [[tags/engineering/index|Computer Science]]. The start of this blog and the end of the degree overlapped a bit — any of those posts will be marked here.

Unless I somehow get lured back into a degree later on, I doubt there will be many new posts here.
