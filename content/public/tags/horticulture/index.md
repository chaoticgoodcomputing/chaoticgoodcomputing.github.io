Horticulture is a term I started using during the [[tags/horticulture/seasons/rhythm/index|Season of Rhythm]], specifically picked up from the term [[content/notes/digital-gardening-with-quartz|digital gardening.]]

Most of the time, horticulture relates to maintaining [[tags/horticulture/seasons/systems/index|systems]] like this blog, along with other personal systems that either maintain my ability to manage my own life, and, in turn, might require their own maintenance over time.
