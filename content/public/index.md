This site is a dedicated [[tags/horticulture/index|digital garden]] of articles, tutorials, and notes related to my personal life and work, as well as work I do through Chaotic Good Computing, a separate business I run for consulting and [[tags/projects/index|OSS projects]] around [[tags/economics/index|economics]], [[tags/engineering/index|engineering]], and [[tags/projects/teaching/index|teaching]].
